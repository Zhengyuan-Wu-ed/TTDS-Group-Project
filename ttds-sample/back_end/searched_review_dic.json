That is to say, the previous couple of times I've seen it was the old DVD from Paramount with washed out colors and cropped. The Blu-ray from Criterion is gorgeous though, and it really increased my appreciation of the film. This might be Malick's most beautiful film with large portions filmed during magic hour, a heavy emphasis on natural light, and a focus on slightly underexposing the image producing gorgeous images from beginning to end. I'd never really appreciated just how pleasing the movie was to look at with the Paramount DVD. That being said, this is largely the one Malick that I have the most trouble feeling on an emotional level. Everything else gets me, but I think I now understand the distance I feel after my third viewing.The story is set in 1916 when Bill, his younger sister Linda, and Bill's girlfriend Abby flee from Chicago after Bill accidentally kills a supervisor in the mill he's working at and they make for the panhandle of Texas where they work bundling a wheat crop for a reserved and young farmer. Bill and Abby work hard in the field while Linda is always off to the side, and that's how the movie is really told. It's all done with Linda's voiceover as she observes without any real emotional connection to the events. Some find this incredibly involving, but I feel like it creates a disconnect between the film and the audience. Even her brother leaving the movie at a certain point seems to have no real impact on her.So, Abby captures the eye of the Farmer, and Bill overhears the Farmer's doctor say that he has only a year to live at the most. Bill, having resigned himself to a life of mediocrity, sees his chance to the big score, and he talks Abby into marrying the Farmer, assuming he won't survive the year. This is where the recurring motif of Eden on Earth appears in Days of Heaven. The idyllic, natural life on the farm with little care of practical reality settles on the four characters, and they're all happy. However, the seeds of their own unhappiness never leave them since paradise is impossible on Earth. Abby does love Bill, and Bill finds it harder and harder to hide his affection for Abby as well as his increasing jealousy over Abby's steadily increasing affection for the Farmer. The Farmer also can't deny that this \"brother\" and \"sister\" are remarkably close physically, spiking concern and jealousy in him. This is the emotional core of the film, and Linda feels disconnected from it. Since she's the character that we see the action through, I feel like it acts as a disservice to the emotional reality of the story at play.Bill eventually leaves with a trio of circus performers, and, left behind, Abby and the Farmer get closer and closer, but the Farmer still can't quite let go of the idea that Abby and her \"brother\" were up to something, especially when the Farmer's long-time associate brings up the idea on his own. It all comes crashing back down when Bill comes back, gets caught in a private moment with Abby by the Farmer which is really just a goodbye, and a plague of locusts hit the new summertime fields of wheat. The arrival of Bill and the locusts so close together is a connection that no one mentions in the film, but it seems undeniable that the two are linked narratively. Bill's reappearance is the spiritual destruction of the peace of the farmhouse in the same way that the locusts are the physical destruction of it. On top of it, the Farmer's reaction to both makes both worse. He ignites a fire in the fields on accident and allows the fire to burn up his entire crop while, afterwards, the Farmer attacks Bill.Interestingly, the movie returns to the Eden on Earth motif after Abby, Bill, and Linda flee the farm. They take a boat down the river, and left to their own private devices for a short time, they are once again happy to a certain extent, but much like the first appearance of a false paradise, this one must come to a violent end as well.I've seen Days of Heaven three times now, and I still feel a certain disconnect emotionally. I really think that's because the film is told from Linda's perspective. She never feels emotionally connected to anything around her, so when big emotional things happen, we get her voiceover that doesn't seem to reflect the emotion of the scene.Still, the movie really is gorgeous. Really, it's really, really pretty to simply look at. It seems like a weird thing to really emphasis, but when a movie looks this good from opening frame to closing, it really deserves mention. Malick and his Director of Photography, N\u00e9stor Almendros, made something gorgeous without feeling fake in any way, and it was entirely done on purpose. The underexposure that de-emphasized the blue skies makes for a wonderful image, but it apparently irritated the old-school Hollywood crew to a rather unreasonable degree.I'm not sure why Malick decided to stop making movies after this. He apparently got deep into the pre-production work on Q, which eventually morphed into The Tree of Life and Voyage of Time 30 years later, and he realized he couldn't actually make the film so he just upped with his girlfriend to Paris for two decades. I'm really glad he took the time, I supposed, because I feel like the work he made when he came back is his best work.", "publish_date": "1978", "category": "Drama,Romance"}, "index_1": {"review_id": "rw6452954", "reviewer": "rnixon-15663", "movie": "the midnight sky", "rating": "4", "review_summary": "The Midnight Sky", "review_date": "7 January 2021", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "The Midnight sky\n2020\n12A\nDirector: George Clooney\nStarring: Geroge Clooney, Felicity Jones, David Oyelowo, Caoillinn Springall etcOverall rating 41/100The midnight sky is about a scientist called Augustine (George Clooney) who is alone in the arctic. As re races to stop Sully (Felicity Jones) and her fellow astronauts from returning to earth after a mystery global catastrophe. The midnight sky was just bad, it left me feeling nothing for the movie at all, which Is a shame because it had potential and had some great moments, so lets get started.Lets be nice and start off with a few positives the movie had an interesting concept, intriguing plot elements and fantastic cinematography. The movies concept was actually very interesting, having a global catastrophe and having the conflict of the point of view from earth and in space was very interesting to me. I also thought there was some good and intriguing plot elements, I found a lot of the concepts on the ship in space was really interesting in terms of holograms of family members etc and having the little girl to create growth in Augustine was well done as well. Next the films cinematography was excellent and the best part of the movie, wow this movie did look fantastic, the CGI was fantastic , and the attention to detail with the colours and the worlds was amazing, it was breath-taking to look at.However, my first few negatives are the bad narrative structure, inconsistent character screen time and terrible pacing issues. The way this movie was structured was terrible, it tried to have 3 different perspectives and it just didn't work. As soon as you were starting to connect with a character or an interesting plot point was happening they switched too a completely different set of characters that if I am being honest I didn't really care about. It really effected the pacing and the connection to any of the characters. I also found there was inconsistent character screen time because of this. It just felt like the movie did too much with the characters so it actually ended up with them actually not having nowhere near enough depth or development that is needed with a movie with this much intended dramatic heft to it. The pacing for this movie was also awful. The movie was just incredibly slow and not interesting most of the time, a large chunk of the movie felt very repetitive with hardly anything happening and the pacing never really improved as the movie went on.My next few negatives would be the lack of connection to the characters and the lack of emotional connection to the movie, as well as the lack of detail to the plot and the bland script. I had no connection to the characters throughout the movie, they were either really blandly written so therefore boring to watch or just very corny or unlikeable I also found the usage of the child version of iris to be badly cast and written into the movie, yes the bond between her and Augustine was nice but due to her not talking she was a very passive protagonist and just felt unneeded. Because of this I had no emotional connection to the movie at all. Because I didn't care or know enough about most of the characters, I felt no emotion towards any of the characters being killed off which with a sci fi drama like this should not be the case and just further proves my point of the poorly written plot and characters, the script in general was bland and generic, the dialogue was very corny and predictable at times as well. I also found there was a considerable lack of detail to the plot. The movie had this big emphasis on the world being uninhabitable and a global catastrophe but failed to actually mention why or what caused it making a lot of the movie feel pointless or lack the needed depth to it.My final positives would be the good building of tension in places, the performances and chemistry between characters as well as the good character background for Augustine. The movie did build tension well with some of the movies action scenes which I did like, I genuinely didn't know if the characters were going to survive in parts so it kept me on the edge of my seat. The performances in the movie were also great. Felicity Jones did a good job with what she had and had loads of charm. But George Clooney was fantastic. His performance was versatile, emotional and powerful. I also found the chemistry between George Clooney and the child actor Caoilinn Springall was excellent, despite no dialogue for the character the movie developed both their relationship well and he became a great protective father figure for her. And finally the movie had a good amount of character background for Augustine. We got to learn what kind of man he was and the sacrifices and mistakes he made in the past, this made me understand his character a lot more and made his mental state developing throughout the movie that much more interesting.My final couple of negatives would be the forced drama/lapses in the logic and the terribly executed plot twist. The drama that this movie created for me just felt very forced, it never really served any purpose or meaning to the plot it was just deigned to try and build tension and put the characters in dangerous situations it just never felt fluent or natural and just felt very forced. I also thought the plot twist was terribly executed. Having Felicity jones's character being Augustine 's actual daughter and the little girl not being real for me was a terrible plot twist, it made a lot of the movie pointless for me and the connection and chemistry built between the two was just wasted, it also wasn't a satisfying character arc for Augustine as he still never got to see his daughter.Overall, The midnight sky had potential. Was visually stunning and had great performances. But just has poorly constructed characters and plot and lacks the required depth and emotion that a movie like this needs, making me feel empty after watching.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Drama,Fantasy,Sci-Fi"}, "index_2": {"review_id": "rw6075510", "reviewer": "Treammolb", "movie": "tenet", "rating": "5", "review_summary": "A daring, but unintelligible mess", "review_date": "8 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Tenet, the latest outing by director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar) presents an interesting and ambitious idea, that has been done amazingly well and attempted horrendously even more times: the concept of time travel. Tenet falls somewhere in the middle between these two maxims. The distinguishing element in Tenet as compared to other time travel movies is the world building: when characters go back in time, they have to abide by certain rules, such as that certain elements work in reverse (when hit by a flame, you get cold instead of hot, for example). It also seems objects can go back in time, meaning you can shoot someone, by having shot somewhere earlier, and the bullet then flying back in time. I say seems, because the concept is never very well explained. Early on one of the scientists who attempts to explain the mechanics says so early on \"don't try to understand it, feel it.\" That message is apparently supposed to be taken literally, as you will often be left wondering what the hell is going on.I will make a note here, however, that there is a chance the film does a glorious job explaining the mechanics. However, the sound mixing was horrendous. Ludwig Gorannsson (Black Panther) delivers the score, which aggressively pulses through the film at nearly all times. Nolan continues his trend of accompanying every scene with music: both a casual sitdown at a restaurant, as well as the action scenes. This works very well for the action scenes, but not for the dialogues, as the score drowns out the dialogue, making it increasingly frustrating to figure out what is going on. Sometimes the background noises in an environment add to the plight of trying to understand the dialogue; there is an unbelievably frustrating scene on a boat where due to the waves not a lick of dialogue can be understood. It is an odd choice in a film which requires the viewer to pay attention to try and figure out what is happening due to the novel time travel technology. Nolan also employs lots of crosscuts between scenes where mechanics are explained, plots are hatched, and put in motion, all in one crosscut. So, within 60 seconds, you switch between constant cuts of two characters discussing an important element of how the time travel works, the same two characters in a different location devising a plan to use this element, and then another scene intermixed where the preliminary work of said plan is put into motion. Combine this with the pulsating synths, and the viewer will have a wonderful time trying to keep track of what is going on.This issue is exacerbated due to the fact that not much time is given to actually process anything, because when the action kicks off, it all occurs at a breakneck speed. Nolan still hasn't figured out how to shoot action scenes, managing to film the action in confusing angles and make puzzling cuts that make the action even harder to follow. Due to the time element, where multiple timelines at times align, the action becomes even harder to follow, which is a shame, as some of the setpieces are amazing in scale and action. The time travel causes magnificent action to unfold, with timelines colliding, certain characters appearing both as their future and present selves, future selves going backwards, while present selves are moving forward, which all leads action scenes that have not been experienced before. Sadly enough, you're still trying to figure out what was done, well after an action scene is completed. You're seeing magnificent action appear in front of you, but you just don't know what or why it is happening.It also feels the time mechanics were underused. Early on you see a a bullet hole from a bullet that had not been fired yet, and I was expecting tons of ingenious scenes playing with this idea and trying to push it to its limits. People managing to jump into planes (by somehow going back in time from when they jumped out of it earlier), characters littering a room with bullets, waiting for the impending arrival of the antagonists and then unleashing all the bullets back into the gun hitting the enemies, etc. Instead, this comes back very sparingly in the first half. This gets amped up a lot more in the second half, but, as mentioned before, you still don't truly understand what is going on, making the action feel somewhat dull despite how much of a technical feat it all is. In a sense, Tenet could have done away with the attempt at trying to appear as an intellectual movie and have just given the characters superpowers, instead of trying to come up with contrived rules on how the timetravel mechanics work, as you won't be able to understand the rules anyway.There is a core issue at the heart of Tenet, however, and that is that it doesn't touch you emotionally: you don't understand the characters, and you don't feel anything for them. In Nolan's previous efforts, of which Inception is probably the best example, as it seems like Tenets spiritual predecessor, you care about the characters. Cobb and Mall had their tragic love story where they went too far with their powers and lost everything they held dear. Cobb's constant fear of getting lost in the dreamworld, or, perhaps, his desire to be there, warring against each other. His constant mission to be reunited with his children versus him missing his wife. Behind every action scene, there were high, personal stakes. This is the issue with most action movies: you don't care about the destruction of a skyscraper or the explosion of a planet, if there is no emotional connection to any of these events.Tenet shares this problem as the characters all seem emotionally detached from the film's plot which centers around stopping an evil mastermind of destroying the world. The Protagonist (this is the character's name, he is never given an actual name) ironically is just that, an empty shell, an infallible character, with no emotional connection to the plot. Then we have Neil, a mysterious agent, so mysterious that you know nothing about him until the very end and so anything he does carries no emotional weight. Kat, is the only one with personal stakes as she is married to the evil mastermind and he is holding her hostage, but she seems more like a constant damsel in distress that just needs saving and actually seems to have nothing to do with the main plotline. As her struggles don't seem to connect with the actual plot of the film, the plot has no emotional weight to it. Even if it did, however, it still wouldn't help, as the film almost solely focuses on the Protagonist and his mission to save the world. Perhaps the film would have worked better if she was more part of the core of the film and got more agency, lending higher personal stakes to the overall plotline, but instead we follow the Protagonist and Neil completing action scene after action scene in an attempt to save the world from an evil mastermind whose rationale you don't understand, by using time travel mechanics that you don't understand, and saving Kat for a reason you don't understand.All in all, it's a daring attempt at a idea that has been done many times before, but not yet done in a manner so ambitious. However, the dumbfounding decision to play music over all expository dialogue, failing to make the viewer feel emotional connection to the characters, and subpar cinematography and editing makes this more of waste of potential than anything else.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Action,Sci-Fi,Thriller"}, "index_3": {"review_id": "rw3429299", "reviewer": "RLTerry1", "movie": "10 cloverfield lane", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Exciting and Enigmatic", "review_date": "10 March 2016", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Extremely suspenseful and enigmatic! Within minutes of the beginning of the movie, you will be sucked into the twisted and claustrophobic subterranean world at 10 Cloverfield Lane. Not directly connected to Cloverfield (2008), this film quite possibly takes us to a moment concurrent to or just before/after the events in New York City caught on the handicam. Director Dan Trachtenberg and Producer J.J. Abrams work together to shock the audience with a movie that will keep you guessing right up until the end. Brilliantly cast and written, 10 Cloverfield Lane is an excellent old- school feeling horror film that you have got to experience in IMAX. Just when you think you have it figured out, you will immediately begin to second guess yourself. Probably the most brilliant part of the film is the fact that three principle characters can keep your interest and attention the entire time without ever a feeling of boredom or annoyance. From the writing to the cinematography and visual effects, this film is sure to keep you on the tip of your toes.Following a car accident, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up with an IV in her arm and chained to a wall. With no cell reception and no recollection of what happened, she begins to fear the worst. Upon meeting her capture Howard (John Goodman), she fears for her life. Not buying his story about saving her and keeping her from the hard during the fallout from the attack, Michelle attempts to escape. Failing to overcome Howard, she slowly begins to accept the worst. To her surprise, she is not the only one in Howard's fallout shelter. Michelle meets Emmett (John Gallagher Jr). Thinking that Emmett's injuries are from escaping, she learn that his broken arm is from fighting to get INTO Howard's shelter. With this new revelation, Michelle begins to settle into life with Howard and Emmett. Still, something just isn't right. From car noises to sunshine, Michelle has doubts of the alleged apocalypse and must solve the mysteries, puzzles, and covertly plan her escape.One of the most intriguing elements of the movie is personally feeling the claustrophobia that the principle cast is experiencing in the movie. That is thanks to the excellent cinematography, production design, and lighting. That additional experiential element is not terribly common in films, even horror cinema. But it was very instrumental in generating the feeling of suspense, anticipation, and intrigue during the movie. Much like Super 8 and in the vein of other J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot productions, the movie begins with a fantastic and blood curdling accident. Just like a roller-coaster, once that car accident hits the screen, the movie will take you up and down thrilling hills on a track that you will struggle to see 10 feet ahead. It's difficult to talk about how the movie keeps you guessing and second guessing yourself without giving away a lot of what makes the movie thrilling. So, you will just have to take my word for it. Like with any good horror/suspense movie, it is necessary to include strategic comedic relief or lighthearted moments. And writers Drew Goddard, Daniel Casey, Matthew Stuecken, and Josh Campbell weave together a brilliant combination of terror and humor to keep the movie alive and dynamic.John Goodman is absolutely brilliant in the film. Not that he has anything to prove. He is one of those actors who, with the slightest tweak of the face or shift of the eyes, can have you laughing one second and terrified the next. His ability to turn his character's emotion on a dime makes him equally weird/quirky and frightening all at the same time throughout the story. Is he a weird old man who, in his own awkward and bizarre way, is keeping Michelle and Emmett from hard or his is a sadistic serial killer who forms inappropriate intimate bonds with his \"guests\"? That is for you to discover in the movie. Both Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr were perfect choices for their respective roles as well. Winstead brings that independent spirit and look to the character of Michelle and Gallagher provides the audience with a country boy charm. The ability for an actor to capture the emotion of extreme terror and sell it as a legitimate, believable emotion is tough. Selling that acute and powerful emotion can make or break a horror film\u2013if the director's intent is to make the story as real as possible and not a parody or satire of itself.You may be wondering how this film is even loosely connected to 2008's Cloverfield. And that connection isn't really made until the end of the third act of the movie. Unfortunately, I cannot go into too much detail without giving away the climactic and over-the-top ending, but I can say that it does a great job of being connected just enough that it can essentially stand on its own but when you think of how it is or could be connected to Cloverfield, then the movie becomes all the more intriguing. Interestingly, the manner in which this installment in the Cloverfield universe was directed and produced, it definitely could begin a franchise with movies that are never directly connected to the previous film or even Super 8, but are taking place at or near the same time, each with it's own respective story.It isn't often that I watch movies that are best seen in IMAX, but this is definitely one that is best appreciated and experienced in IMAX; however, if you want to take the old-school feel of the movie to a who other level, then you may want to consider watching the movie at a local drive-in. However you choose to watch the film, you are going to definitely enjoy the adventure.", "publish_date": "2016", "category": "Action,Drama,Horror"}, "index_4": {"review_id": "rw6366463", "reviewer": "sofiadionigi", "movie": "her", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Outstandingly Unique, and a Critique on Technology", "review_date": "14 December 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "The film Her successfully depicts a future in which technology has expanded and has drastically been used as a distraction from the difficulties of life.\nTo engage the viewers' emotions, the film uses a theme of colours throughout the movie which express deep feelings of the characters and their environment. The main colour that Theodore wears is red, a colour depicting feelings of passion and love. Theodore wears this colour to show his undying desire for romance, and he tends to stand out from the crowd, as other characters within the shots are usually wearing very muted colours. When he is in a severe state of loneliness though, he wears whites and browns causing him to blend in more with others. The viewer is able to feel Theodore's emotions and engage with them as colours change and represent so much more than just an aimless choice of colour within the outfits.\nIt is clear that Theodore is constantly seen as having moments of isolation and depression, though he distracts himself instead of working on them. The role of technology within his daily life and routine becomes a constant theme as his distraction. Every single night, Theodore plays a video game where he is a robot finding his way through nature. Then, at night when he is restless and cannot sleep, he talks to Samantha to clear his head. These repetitive forms of distraction represent his reliance on technology; without it, he would be forced to face his problems entirely head on.\nTo create credibility, the film depicts Theodore and Samantha as odd characters that become more and more likeable and relatable as the film goes on. At the beginning, Theodore is depicted as just a creepy loner with not much going on in his life. He starts off as plain, but as his emotions and true intentions become evident, it is easy to fall in love with him as he turns out to be a kind and emotional man, that deserves love and happiness within his life. This is something that pretty much everyone can relate to, and it is what strings us along for the ride. Samantha also forms credibility, as her voice carries so many emotions even though she is supposed to be an AI. Scarlett Johansson is the amazingly talented actress that voices Samantha, and the way that she speaks, sings and carries her lines makes us respect the character and her feelings so much more.\nThe tone of the movie is very lonely but also quite romantic. These two tones work in contrast to one another, which captures an exceptional feeling throughout. Within a lonely world taken over by technology, many of the characters such as Theodore and his friend, Amy, find themselves locked up with their emotions of loneliness. Amy has just gotten out of a relationship as well, and she is lonely enough to rely on an OS1 that her husband had left behind. To combat the tone of loneliness, Theodore writes letters which are exceptionally romantic and emotional. He may be lonely, but it is clear that he is a hopeless romantic who wants more than anything to just find love.\nThe target audience for this film seems to be people in their 30s and 40s, similar to most of the characters within the film. The film does depict the life of a lonely working man, who has just been divorced, which may be highly relatable for others around his age watching the film. The film is also an Indie film, which means that the subject matter is raw and honest, which may not be for everybody. Most people that enjoy Indie films are able to accept the theme of love with an AI, as it is not completely unlikely of happening in the present day. The film also touches on real life scenarios, deeper questions of society, and a wry, witty humour which may not be loved by everybody. Also, the film is rated R, meaning that it is not intended for younger audiences. There is nudity, swearing and other themes not suitable for children. Much of the dialogue can only really be understood by older generations, which shows how its target audience is linked closely to adults.\nAlthough the film was released in 2013, Jonze had come up with the idea for the film in the earlier 2000s. During this time, AIs were just starting to develop, and the idea of having connections and conversations with them started to become more prominent. While people were starting to acknowledge the extreme growth of technologies, it posed many questions for people that have become curious and interested in learning more about AI technologies. The film is also depicted in a future Los Angeles, and was mostly filmed there as well as some parts in Shanghai. The city of Los Angeles is brilliantly turned into a more technologically advanced version with the help of CGI, and many shots of the bright city of Shanghai are used in background shots as well. This environment shows what a future Los Angeles could really look like one day, and it is really cool to reimagine it as a bright futuristic city.\nThe film Her successfully engages the viewer by depicting a futuristic world where AI technology is closely connected to humans, and causes the viewer to questions their connection with technology. Due to the present year, it is clear to see that technology has already taken over, and the sci-fi world that is depicted in the movie is closely related to the world of today. After watching the film, many people may question if they need to take a break from their electronics so that they can focus on the world around them and on the people that they love.\nHonestly, this film was a pleasure to watch as it was inspiring and touching, though it could have been improved if it was slightly less cheesy and if it lessened having to express emotions verbally all of the time. Most of the emotions felt by characters are expressed in words, and it would be better if a lot more was just expressed through facial expressions to create deeper meanings. Most of the romance and quotes used are quite unrealistic, though it may just be exactly what audience members are looking for. Even though I was overwhelmed by the cheesiness of the film, it may just be the redeeming factor for the hopeless romantics.\nAll in all, this film is an emotional rollercoaster. At the beginning, this movie felt weird and dry, and also quite depressing. As the film slowly moved along, it became easier to fall in love with each character and I oddly found myself rooting for the ridiculous love between Theodore and Samantha. It is also an exquisite science fiction film depicting a not-too-distant future, and poses questions as to whether or not technology is helpful, or more unhelpful as it acts as a distraction from reality.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_5": {"review_id": "rw2489614", "reviewer": "jakebyrer", "movie": "the social network", "rating": null, "review_summary": "The Theme of Deceit in The Social Network", "review_date": "17 September 2011", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "The movie The Social Network details the creation of the wildly popular social networking service called Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, first comes up with an idea to rate the looks of girls on the Harvard campus after his girlfriend abruptly leaves him earlier in the night. As he is stirring in his anger and drunkenness, he comes up with the idea for rating the looks of girls and calls the web page FaceMash. After e-mailing the site to several people, the news about FaceMash spreads around campus like wildfire and eventually crashes the Harvard computer network in only four hours due to the abundance of network traffic. Mark Zuckerberg then teams up with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, played by Armie Hammer and Josh Pence respectively, to create a type of social network service for Harvard students called the Harvard Connection. Mark Zuckerberg builds upon the idea of the Harvard Connection as he works with Eduardo Saverin, the financier played by Andrew Garfield, and Dustin Moskovitz, the programmer played by Joseph Mazzello. The rest of the movie follows the events that lead to the Facebook that is known today as it is remembered by the characters during their discussions about the two lawsuits against Mark Zuckerberg. A main theme in the movie The Social Network is deceit as it deals with the relationships between Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins and also between Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin. One of the two lawsuits against Zuckerberg is initiated by the Winklevoss twins because they feel that Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for the Harvard Connection and renamed it Facebook. Saverin leads the other lawsuit because he feels that he was cheated by having his stake in the company diluted to an amount less than one-tenth of one percent. He originally was the person to put up money to get Facebook started and feels that he deserves a share of the millions of dollars made on that idea. Instead, the trickery of Zuckerberg and Sean Parker, played by Justin Timberlake, lead to the complete dissolution of Eduardo Saverin with Facebook. The main theme of dishonesty and deceit are well known to fans of the movie titled Deception that was released in 2006. It is easy to think that someone is your friend, just to find out that everything was a big lie in the end. Many times throughout the movie, the theme of deceit is illustrated through the emotional reactions of characters. One such instance is when Saverin goes to Palo Alto to the new headquarters of Facebook in a house that he is paying for. After waiting for an hour for Zuckerberg to pick him up, Saverin arrives at the house to find Sean Parker on the phone making business decisions on the phone. The camera switches between subjective point of view shots of Saverin and Parker. The camera is able to catch the raw emotional feelings of deception on Saverin's face. The ensuing discussion between Saverin and Zuckerberg further reveals the hurt and treachery that is felt by Saverin.Another extremely important scene involving Saverin and Zuckerberg is near the end of the movie. When Saverin is told to come to California to a party for celebrating the one millionth user of Facebook, he learns that Parker and Zuckerberg agreed to issue more stock. The result is that Saverin's one-third ownership in the company is reduced to less than one-tenth of one percent. Eduardo instantly feels betrayed and rushes over to Zuckerberg, who is wired in with headphones on. The camera uses a low angle shot of Saverin as he swiftly walks over to Zuckerberg. The pain is quite obvious on Eduardo's face as the camera follows him to Zuckerberg. The actions following further display the pain and deception felt by Eduardo Saverin.Another technique used in this movie to illustrate the mood and emotions of characters is the lighting conditions. In the scenes described above, the lighting is somewhat dim to create a negative mood that can be felt and witnessed by the audience. The use of low-key lighting puts more of the attention on the main characters of the scenes. Our attention is immediately consumed with the actions and reactions of the main characters such as Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, and Sean Parker. Low-key lighting also helps to create the gloomy mood displayed throughout much of the movie. Most of the lighting used in the movie is front lighting so we have a clear picture of the characters faces and their emotional reactions to different situations. The different lighting techniques helps the audience to identify the emotions felt by the characters and also helps to illustrate the theme of deceit as it is experienced by the various characters. All throughout the movie, it is easy for the audience to see the emotions of the characters as the actors and actresses do a great job of displaying real emotion with their expressions and body language. The main theme of deceit is evident throughout the movie as many of the characters feel cheated and deceived by Mark Zuckerberg. The Social Network is a great movie that details that controversial history of the hugely popular social networking service called Facebook.", "publish_date": "2010", "category": "Biography,Drama"}, "index_6": {"review_id": "rw5774972", "reviewer": "rnixon-15663", "movie": "the willoughbys", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "The Willoughbys", "review_date": "26 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "The Willoughby's\n2020\nPG\nDirector: Kris Pearn and Cory Evans\nStarring: Terry Crews, Ricky Gervais, Alessia Cara, Maya Rudolph, Will Forte, Martin Short, Jane Krakowski etc\nOverall rating 82/100\nThe Willoughby's is based on four children, whose parents pay them no attention so they decide to make them go on an adventurous holiday to get rid of them for good, but when a babysitter comes round to look after them they must find out the true meaning of family. I thought The Willoughby's was an exceptionally good movie and offered a fair few different and unique parts to animation that I haven't seen before. So, let's talk about this more in detail.Firsts of all I loved the style of animation and the narration from Ricky Gervais throughout and the voice cast. The film's style of animation was really different to other film's of the genre which I really enjoyed, the whole 2D, stop motion feel to the film was really fun and enjoyable. The whole voice cast was fantastic as well. People like Maya Rudolph and Terry Crews have such distinct voices they were the perfect choice for an animated film and both characters were great fun throughout. Ricky Gervais was also fantastic and his narration throughout the movie was one of the key standouts for me, he bought a lot of humour and developed the story well at a brisk pace that kept it enjoyable and easy to follow throughout.Next the film was very funny, and they built a good story world throughout. The film's slapstick humour with the kids was fantastic and consistently funny throughout. And as previously mentioned Ricky Gervais was fantastic. But they also managed to execute a unique form of humour with the parent's complete dimness on how to care for children and the dynamic between them both was great. The film also managed to build a great story world throughout. Whether it was the importance of the Willoughby's house, or the slight difference of the world we are used to living in but slightly enhanced to make it more fun for the movie, they did this very well throughout and by the End I felt like I knew the world of the movie and the characters within it.My next two positives would be the film's interesting perspective of family and the good themes. The film went for a different more serious and emotional perspective on what family is then perhaps other animated movies are afraid to portray. Having the parents not care about their children and for them to fend for themselves was a really interesting dynamic to the film for me and was explored well. The film also had good themes on adoption and the true meaning of family. The film tackled sensitive issues well leading to many heart-warming moments. However, my first negative would be that I personally lacked an emotional connection to the movie. Despite the themes tackled and my connection to the characters throughout I sadly did not feel emotionally connected to the film, I am not sure why but whenever any emotionally intended scenes came on it sadly didn't do anything for me.My next two positives would be the film's likeable characters and it's charming tone. The three children were extremely likeable throughout and all had distinct and loveable personalities to them that really made you connect with them more and more as the film went on. Maya Rudolph and Terry crewses characters were also likeable due to their willingness to be their for the kids and for showing them the true meaning of love and family. Adding onto my previous point due to the likeable characters the whole film had a oddly charming tone that didn't go away. Because I felt more and more connected to the characters the film's charm was great, It was an odd charm not like the usual animated movies before this but it worked for this particular movie.My final two negatives would be that the film was fairly generic and that there was a few odd creative decisions. The film did follow most of the genre conventions that I am used to seeing with animated family movies so therefore didn't do much to surprise me, despite the different perspective on family and the themes I still feel the film played it slightly safe in places. And for me some of the creative decisions like making the parents permanently not love their kids even when they saved their lives was slightly odd and I would of personally found it more satisfying if there was some form of resolution or some form of love or respect between the parents and the Willoughby children.My final two positives would be the film's soundtrack and the satisfying ending. The film's fun songs fitted in with the tone of the movie perfectly and the fantastic voice of Alessia cara really added a lot to some of the songs and was absolutely beautiful to listen to. And the ending despite my previous point of the odd creative choice was satisfying. To have all of the kids find new happiness and a family that loves and cares for them In Maya Rudolph and Terry Crew's character was very heart-warming and well earned that left me happy with how the movie turned out when it was all over.Overall. despite a few connection issues and issues with some of the creative choices within the plot. The Willoughby's was a great animated movie that largely offered something different with its characters and visual style that makes me want more animated movies like this.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Adventure,Animation,Comedy"}, "index_7": {"review_id": "rw5947800", "reviewer": "acinemalens", "movie": "paris, texas", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "Paris, Texas: A Journey to Explore Emotion", "review_date": "28 July 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Another Wim Wenders retrospective screened in the Busan Cinema Center. This time, it was Paris, Texas (1984). What caught my attention by the positive raves it received, such as the 1984 Palm D'or, the FIPRESCI Prize, BAFTA Best Direction for Wenders, and other prestigious awards. It is not surprising that many claimed the movie was one of the best in Wender's filmography. Entering the theater with no knowledge at all (seriously, I was clueless about the story this time), I came out with tears in my eyes and still feeling speechless of what I just watched and felt, knowing that this film will stay in my memories for a while, and if not, for ages.The film opens with a man named Travis Henderson (Harris Dean Stanton), walking alone in the Texan desert. Working with Wenders' long-time collaborator Robby Muller, who really took advantage of the vast, empty land into a visually appealing, imagery-filled landscape that captures the essence of our main character. Accompanied by Ry Codder's acoustic guitar arrangement, the film not only introduces us to a western genre that seems bizarre but also strengthens the feeling of loss and loneliness of the main character. Moreover, Codder's absorbing tune really absorbs us deeper into the character, pulling us further into the story where we do not know what will happen next. This combination of cinematography and soundtrack is truly well built, leading to ambiguity and suspense.Next thing we know, Travis lost consciousness and a German doctor examines him. As Travis did not say a word or possess a telephone number, he calls the number that connects to Walt, Travis' brother. Despite having not seen him for 4 years, Walt went to pick him up, which leads to a flashback sequence where we follow the story of Travis's past and try to connect with the people he encountered in his previous life before his disappearance. Now, I'll just stop the synopsis here and hope that I do not spoil the story too much already. In my opinion, this is a film that is best experienced when clueless, similar to our main character wandering in the desert.The screenplay, which is penned by Sam Shepard, is an absolute powerful screenplay not because of the storyline, but rather, because of the emotions that serve as the core of the film for our audience to explore. Joy, sadness, fear, anger...Name any other emotions and most of them would be present in the film. Wenders served those emotions raw, without any fabrication even though the story felt almost impossible to happen in real life. Just small moments, like the way Walt and Travis interact with each other, would really lighten up my feelings. But what is more fascinating is how Wenders scattered the emotions throughout the film in a way that fits neatly with the atmosphere and builds the proper momentum. This is especially true in two of my favorite scenes in the film - one of which is when Travis looks at his past recordings to recollect his memories. It's an extremely wonderful moment where I just laughed with tears of sadness flowing through my cheeks. As for my other favorite scene...I will discuss it later down below. But I am certain, I believe everyone can connect to the story through the same reasons: in order to feel those emotions that I strongly felt.The actors' performances were something I rarely experienced. They were on another level...it was another reason why they perfectly managed to capture my emotions and evoke such strong reactions. Now, I never really watch Harry Dean Stanton films since I wasn't really into old films until today, although I do know he has been usually cast in laid-back, supporting roles. Regardless of the films he had played, Stanton perfectly fits the part with his range of emotions, whether through expressions, dialogue, or aura. Hunter Carson, who played as Hunter (yes, they both have the same name) also magnificently nailed the role. His performance was unlike most child actors that have a tolerably stiff performance; it was almost like a professional, despite being a debut. Lastly, Nastassja Kinsky, who played as Jane, might have short screen time but made a lasting impression in the film. I especially love the scene when she converses with Travis. It's just unbelievable. Most of it was done with long takes and no cuts, yet they are so into character that we were transported into their world and what will happen next, paying no attention to the technical detail of that scene. For me, the conversation between those two characters was truly the highlight of the film, thanks to its additional eccentric production design, colorful cinematography, and Codders' beautiful soundtrack. In fact, I am listening to it right now as I'm writing this review.All in all, Paris, Texas is just a perfect film that will stay in my memories for a long time. I would usually analyze the movie's external and technical aspects but as I am too emotionally invested in the film, guess I'll skip the commentary for this time and maybe analyze it the second time watching. That says a lot about how good the film was. It truly is a must-watch! A very fascinating story with incredibly real and raw moments.", "publish_date": "1984", "category": "Drama"}, "index_8": {"review_id": "rw6370677", "reviewer": "josi-21594", "movie": "extremely loud & incredibly close", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "A sad and touching story of a young boy trying to connect himself with his death father", "review_date": "16 December 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "The movie \"Extremely loud and Incredibly close\" published in 2011, deals with the events of 9/11 and the consequences for a young boy, who lost his father during the attack. Right from the beginning the tragic story is able to generate my emotions. Due to their brilliant interpretations of their roles, it was easy to emphasize with the characters and to understand their feelings, which makes the happenings even more emotional. Although the roles were really hard to play, it seemed as if the actors are really able to identify with their characters. The facial expressions and gestures of the renter and the untypical and mature characteristics of the nine-year-old protagonist \"Oskar\" (Thomas Horn) make the story line very special and unique. It shows how young children are forced to give up their childhood and find themselves confronted with tragedies and the loss of beloved persons. The movie shows the process of grief and development of a young boy called Oskar, who lost his father at 9/11 and is now trying to overcome this pain and loss by questing for the suitable lock for the key he has found in the closet of his dad.\nParticularly the fact that Oskar tries to find ways to build up a connection to his death father, because he misses him a lot, was really touching, because it shows how a young boy tries to deal with a bad stroke of fate. Many scenes of the movie show how helpless Oskar is and tries to cope with the loss, but can't find a way to overcome this pain, especially the part, when Oskar hurts himself, which makes me really emotional, because it shows his desperateness and helplessness. I think it is really important to include this part, because it demonstrates what tragic consequences the death of beloved persons can have on a person.\nMoreover, the different methods Oskar tries as well as the meetings with the Blacks, show how strong the love and connection to his father was and how painful the death is for Oskar. In connection to this I really liked the development of Oskar, which is pretty shown in the movie, from a shy and introverted boy to a more open-minded and self-conscious boy, really impressed me and is really inspiring, especially for those, who are in a similar situation. Through the interaction with other people and the quest for the suitable lock, he overcome his boundaries and got to know new people, as well as the renter, who helped him to go through the pain and the hard time and to solve the secret for the key.\nIt was a chaos of emotions, in some scenes you were emotionally touched, other scenes left you shocked, again others inspired you and gave you hope, for example when Oskar coped with the loss of his dad. I think it is really helpful and you can identify with Oskar, because the emotions were so tangible and the death of a loved one is something that can happen to each of us every day. Especially the way they present the process of grief shows that everyone has his own way to cope with the loss of something and it is totally fine to take time and do things that are good for you. In general, the movie was full of emotions and actions making you overthink your life and the way we often take our family and friends for granted. Particularly when Oskar has one of his emotional outbursts, it shows his trauma and how horrible it is to lose someone so close to you. When thinking about persons in the same situation as the protagonist, I can imagine that this movie might help and support them, as it demonstrates them, that they aren't alone and that it is totally fine to mourn and to take your time to cope with your loss.\nAll in all, it can be said that the Oskar's way of dealing with his loss is very inspiring and impressive. He finds relief by finding the suitable lock and thereby feels a connection to his father, making it possible for him to accept his death. Personally, I learned a lot from the movie, as it showed, that mourning is normal and a part of our life. Oskar's development reminds us that bad times will pass by and even if at some point it seems as if we will never be happy again, good times will follow and after a certain time we will be able to live with our loss.", "publish_date": "2011", "category": "Adventure,Drama,Mystery"}, "index_9": {"review_id": "rw2943654", "reviewer": "estebangonzalez10", "movie": "her", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "It's about the need for connection", "review_date": "17 January 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "\"She's not just a computer.\"Her is a beautiful and melancholic film written and directed by Spike Jonze which benefits from a wonderful and sweet performance from Joaquin Phoenix (who goes through a 180 degree transformation from his disturbed and troubling character in The Master to this sympathetic one) and one of the best voice performances I've seen on screen from Scarlett Johansson. I wonder if this film would've worked without her considering that Samantha Morton was originally the voice of Samantha, and only during the editing process did Jonze feel something was missing and decided to recast Johansson. In a film like Her where the need for connection is vital, Jonze found it between Phoenix and Johansson creating a believable and unique love story. It is a touching film that the audience can identify with because it deals with universal themes such as trying to move on from past relationships that we thought would last forever and the void that's left from it. Phoenix captures that melancholy perfectly through his facial expressions contrasted with those flashback scenes where he seemed blissfuly in love. This need for connection is perfectly represented in this film, which also manages to introduce a social commentary as to where we seem to be heading with all the technological advances. The sci-fi elements work really well because we definitely seem to be heading towards this futuristic world and Jonze blends those elements with this beautiful and sad love story. Her is philosophical at times and despite turning into a pretty much standard love story halfway through the film it still manages to be a great meditation on our need as humans for establishing connections (and they no longer need to be human connections). Her is a genuinely nostalgic romantic film that manages to touch its audience and speak to the heart.The story centers on Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) a letter writer who's been separated from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara) for an year, but still hasn't found the strength to sign the divorce papers. He is very good at his job as he excels at expressing feelings through letters, but he's not doing so well at managing his own feelings around others. He is rather lonely and spends most of his time playing video games when he's not at work. He does have a very close friendship with his neighbors, Amy (Amy Adams) and Charles (Matt Letscher), especially with Amy as they both seem to share a sort of brother sisterly kind of love. His life turns around when he purchases a new artificially intelligent operating system, OS1, and immediately connects with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), the voice behind the system. As they continue to spend more time together they begin falling in love with each other which excites Theodore because he's starting to feel alive again, but at the same time fills him with doubts and fears as he's conflicted about having a relationship with an operating system. Samantha also begins to grow intellectually as she experiences new things and is capable of having human emotions. Their unconventional love is what's explored in this film as the two connect and bond with each other.Jonze has crafted a very unique and original story which I found to be a great psychological study on human relations. I wish I would've connected more with this film as I've found it to be on most of my friends top 10 lists for best films of the year, and despite liking this film quite a bit it still didn't manage to make my list. The premise is very interesting and Jonze directs this film masterfully, but I couldn't help and feel that halfway through the film it does become a rather conventional love story (at times it felt like a normal long distance relationship) with some familiar trials that couples go through. I actually never felt a true connection in their relationship until a key moment near the end of the film and that is where I really bought their love story. The elements I connected the most with where the nostalgic feelings of lost love as we got to see some interesting flashbacks between Theodore and Catherine. I also loved the score of this film, the music was lovely and touching. I also enjoyed the social commentary quite a bit which never felt forced. The scene where Theodore is worried about how he will be perceived by his friends for having a relationship like this and how relieved he is when Amy approves is proof that we not only seek connections in life, but we also search for social approval. It's a clever and melancholic film and one that we can all come out of experiencing something completely different (and that is a good thing).", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_10": {"review_id": "rw2988918", "reviewer": "anto_eee", "movie": "noah", "rating": "5", "review_summary": "Director stuck between Visual attraction and Main plot, resulted in a Long & Boring Movie", "review_date": "30 March 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Even after founding the mixed reviews, I went to this film trusting Director's reputation.

The grand picturization of the Arc, Action Scenes, etc ate too much time which shows the struggle in screenplay, in an attempt to balance the best he could achieve.

Wow what a movie! I was truly surprised at how fantastic Black box was, there is so much good stuff to talk about here.My first few positives would be the interesting concept, real and unique relationships and likeable characters. And easy to connect with characters. The whole concept of implanting memories into a different human to me was really interesting and cleverly explored with genuine reasoning for this and compelling characters that we cared about. I also thought that the characters were real and had unique relationships making them easy to connect with. The movie had a very genuine and natural feel to it which I thought was great, the relationships were just like a normal day to day relationships for people watching so the movie felt very grounded which I loved, the relationship between the father and daughter was both unique and heart-warming but also heart-breaking, they had such a lovely bond and you could tell how close they were, but due to the fathers memory loss he just wasn't the same man he once was for his daughter, and to have her be so understanding and know what's going on was really interesting and well handled considering how young she was, due to this kind of relationship as well as the fathers relationship with his brother, it was so much easier to connect with their characters as they reflected real life issues and relationships.My next few positives would be the performances, cinematography, use of sound and Jumpscares. The performances in this movie all round were fantastic, Mamoudou Athie was absolutely fantastic in the lead role, he was charming and passionate and conveyed the characters condition in a believable and real way, the daughter played by Amanda Chrstine was also fantastic for a child actor she was just fantastic, had heaps of charm and charisma and delivered all of her scenes excellently, and a big shout out to Troy James for his role as the backwards man, his acrobatic/ contortionist abilities made the role terrifying and yet compelling to watch and he always does an excellent job in all of his roles. The cinematography here was also excellent, it was very unique and blended the beautiful landscapes and sets of the real world and contrasted it with the virtual reality world excellently for a very visually interesting movie. I also thought the use of sound was excellent, the usage of bones clicking and cracking created a very good uncomfortable tone thanks to Troy James, and the diegetic sound of the doctors voice when Nolan was in the different world was interesting and made you feel like you were part of the movie with his character, the use of sudden Jumpscares was also very effective, the movie didn't rely on Jumpscares because it didn't need to, but when they did have some they were executed very well and startled me on multiple occasions.My only two slight nitpicks would be the lack of detail to certain plot points and the slightly unsatisfying ending for the main character. There was just a slight lack of detail to Nolan's character that would have been nice to have a little bit more depth to it, little things like Nolan's job was only touched upon but never really felt significant, this is only me being slightly picky, I also wished they would of added slightly more to the end to make Nolan's character arc more satisfying, I wanted a little bit more of an emotional reunion between him and his daughter and a little bit more time spent on it, they had enough for it to be satisfying enough but a little bit more could have been added.My next few positives would be the balancing of tones, character background and emotional weight. I thought the movie balanced it's grounded and realistic tone with it's characters and relationships but also the very dark and scary tone of the imaginary world perfectly, neither were overused and balanced each other out very well, I also loved the character background despite the plot twist which we will talk about shortly the movie did a great job at making you understand the character and what Nolan's life was like before his accident that made you connect with his character and his relationships even more. The movie also had a surprising amount of emotional weight, due to how much I connected with the main character and his relationship with his daughter and brother I genuinely wanted him to be ok and to be able to be the man he used to be and when that payed off it was done extremely well and built up very well.My final few positives would be the plot twist, added stakes to the plot and the clever mystery about the reality of the plot and what was real. The movie did an absolutely excellent job at creating the mystery of what Nolan was thinking was real or not, I genuinely didn't know who was telling the truth so hats off to the movie for cleverly manipulating the audience and at least for me genuinely being confused as to what was going to happen, and on that note the plot twist was absolutely excellent and for me completely unexpected, the fact that the doctor implanted her dead sons memories into Nolan's brain, made the whole plot make sense as to why he was so different with his daughter, it was very cleverly done and added so much more stakes for the characters, and added to the well-executed dark tone.Overall despite just a couple of little nitpicks, black box is an absolutely fantastic movie, really taking me by surprise, balancing it's more grounded and realistic tone with genuine emotion and heartfelt relationships, with its surprisingly dark and uncomfortable tone for a perfect blend of the two.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Horror,Mystery,Sci-Fi"}, "index_12": {"review_id": "rw2967546", "reviewer": "mjbrook", "movie": "les mis\u00e9rables", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "Movie Review and argument as to why the film was so successful", "review_date": "24 February 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Movie Review of Les Mis\u00e9rables Les Mis\u00e9rables is a drama-filled and emotion packed film that has received a lot of respect since it was released on the 25th of December, 2012 (Hooper 2012). Originally being a musical on Broadway, Tom Hooper, the director, brought it to the big screen. Hooper followed the story line from the Broadway musical pretty tightly and even kept the live musical style to it. Out of the huge number of actors needed to make this film possible, the main and most well known actors were Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe who played the three main characters of Jean Valjean, Fantine, and Javert (\"Les Mis\u00e9rables\"). The actors, the live singing, and the set design had a large impact on the success of this film, but what I believe won Les Mis\u00e9rables its 51 awards was its easily relating to story plot featuring a hurting economy, a country in the middle of war, and the struggle of a prisoner trying to get back on his feet.The setting for this movie was France in the mid-1800s. The majority of the people in France like in the movie were facing rough economic hardships. There was a lot of poverty and crimes committed because of the economic situation. In the movie, Anne Hathaway played a mother who did everything she could to support her daughter. When Fantine (Hathaway) was fired from her job working in the factory, she had to resort to anything that resulted into her receiving some type of income. Fantine sold her hair and even sold herself into prostitution just to be able to provide for her daughter (\"Les Mis\u00e9rables\"). This scene often reaches out to many parents' emotions because just like Fantine, most would do anything just to provide for their family. Maybe a father has to work a third job or a family has to mortgage their house, and although these sacrifices are not as dramatic or extreme as falling into prostitution, the same emotions are shared from the characters in Les Mis\u00e9rables to the audience. The Revolution trying to overthrow the French government was also displayed in this movie. Like many of us know, with war comes the sacrifices of many lives for the greater good. When I think of war, I do not just think of fighting and blood, I also think of love. With the Revolution in Les Mis\u00e9rables, a large amount of love is shown between characters and their families. Like in society today, many friends or significant others would take a bullet in order to save the person they love just as Eponine, a friend of Marius, did. With Eponine sacrificing her life for a friend, strong emotions are presented to the audience. War veterans and families of war heroes, are immediately connected and engaged in the movie because they can somehow relate themselves to one of the members of the Revolution. Later in the Revolution, all but one student dies leaving the one surviving with despair and devastation. This feeling of despair and devastation is always seen in families and through veterans when lives are lost. Because Hooper was able to engage and connect his audience with those feelings, he was able to make his movie and the meaning of it so much stronger. One last component Hooper was able to correlate with his audience in order to make the movie successful was the struggles of a convict trying to get back on his feet. According to Fox43, a little over 60 percent of inmates return to prison within three years of being released. Seeing Jean Valjean's experience, the audience is able to correlate the hardships that recently released inmates experience. Just as Javert kept a close watch on Jean Valjean, many parole officers and citizens keep a close watch on people that have committed crimes in the past no matter what the present looks like. Just like Jean Valjean, inmates on parole experience struggles of turning their life around and are almost forced to commit another crime just to stay alive. Hooper was able incorporate Valjean's past to show the audience that people can indeed change no matter the circumstances. James Bernardinelli of Reelviews.net stated that Hooper \"draws inspiration as much from the source material as from the musical to result in an engaging production that is guaranteed to enthrall audiences\"(Berardinelli). With the inspiration of Jean Valjean's attempt to recover his footing, the audience is able to become engaged and can relate.Les Mis\u00e9rables is viewed by critics as \"a must see\" and \"spectacular movie.\" This film was able to attain the awards it did by capturing the audiences' emotions and running with them. Hooper used the bad economy, hardships of war, and recidivism as direct connections from the film to its audience and I believe this connection made the film win the awards it did and gain as much success as it gained.", "publish_date": "2012", "category": "Drama,History,Musical"}, "index_13": {"review_id": "rw2882502", "reviewer": "cultfilmfan", "movie": "don jon", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "Don Jon", "review_date": "7 October 2013", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Don Jon, was a film that I had to be a little patient with. What first started as a vulgar, raucous and teen oriented film having little more than jokes involving perverseness and sexual humour and was something that I figured I had wasted my money on, turned out to completely surprise me and ended up as one of my favourite films of this year. Yes, the film does have a lot of sexual humour and content in it, but it has some reason to, seeing as the film is dealing with addiction to pornography. And what may have seemed immature and like teenage humour for the first little bit of the film, soon went away and it became one of the most insightful and intelligent films of the year. I have heard the comparisons to this film from 2011's Steve McQueen directed film, Shame which is also about sexual addiction. Unfortunately, I have not seen Shame yet. I missed it at theatres and every time I go to the library to rent it, it is out, so for obvious reasons I can not compare the two of them. Don Jon, did have a lot to say both about young men and women, sex and relationships. It's the kind of film you would almost want younger teens to see in order to learn something and perhaps plan their own lives and future relationships a little more differently. Here the internet pornography sites serve as a form of escape for this main character and while he likes being around women, he can not connect with them in the same way as he feels he can with things he sees on the computer. This further complicates things for himself because what we see on the internet and in magazines often times are things that are made to look perfect, beautiful and however you want to put it, but other than just looking at it, there is no real connection, or relationship to it. It is hollow and empty and void of any emotional connection or feelings to another person. Perhaps that is why this character can not relate to real women. Everything up to now has been completely empty and void of any feeling, or connection and in his mind if he doesn't have to attach himself in any way to a real woman, he wonders what the point of that is. Throughout the course of the film, our lead character, Jon, meets two very different women, who will both change his outlook and outcome of his way of handling relationships and finding truer meaning to both himself and others as well. The film while crude and a little graphic at times, is far more into psychological and character study than one may think and it is one of the most insightful and accurate looks at young, or basically any type of relationships that I have seen in a long time. Jon, is with one woman who seems to be his dream woman, but right from the start we do not really like her, or at least I didn't. She herself had an unrealistic view of relationships that was more about status symbols and image than about real love for one another as well. The other woman we meet knows more about relationships and more about Jon himself than he may want to admit, or care for her to know, but there is a whole different type of connection and intimacy level there. The film shows that so often young men treat women as sexual objects and fantasies and actually how we can be so demeaning and almost sexist towards them. At the same time, this selfish attitude hurts other people and ourselves because we can not truly ever find anything that is real if we continue on this way because everything has to be perfect, or just like it is on movies, magazines, or the internet and it gives us a false distortion of reality, relationships and other people. The film is the first film written and directed by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt whose acting has impressed me over the years, especially in films like Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin. Now he shows that he can not only act, but write and direct as well. The film has moments of laugh out loud humour, but it also has a tender and emotional side to it as well. It examines these people and what is really behind them and the hurts, or the things they have been through and it is honest both about men, women and relationships in general. As the film ended, I could totally understand the way the film ended and why Levitt, decided to do it in that way. It felt realistic for his character, but at the same time also connected to beauty and happiness. I enjoyed the screenplay and direction immensely as well as the performances were all quite good as well. I liked the quick jump cut editing and the film's use of music in certain scenes, I felt worked really well also. I know some viewers will be turned off by the material and subject matter, but it really is a film worth seeing if you are in a relationship, or even if you are not and this is a film that definitely has something to say. I look forward to future writing and directing projects for Levitt, and as it stands Don Jon, is one of 2013's best and maybe most misunderstood films as well.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Comedy,Drama,Romance"}, "index_14": {"review_id": "rw3457659", "reviewer": "holmantaylor", "movie": "13 hours", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "13 Hours: The Secret Hours of Benghazzi", "review_date": "24 April 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Michael Bay creates a real life, real feeling, and real emotional depiction of the night of September 11, 2012. This film creates a lot of real world emotion and real world appreciation. Obviously, none of us knows exactly what happened the night of the attacks on Benghazi, but we do know the results of what happened that night. Michael Bay did a great job of creating emotion and connectivity between the audience and the characters. Although the movie viewers may not have known many of the details of what was going on, it seemed as if you always knew what direction it was going. Although the movie was two and a half hours long, I didn't feel it was excessive in any way. It kept me engaged, but more importantly it allowed me to develop a strong relationship with the characters and truly care for them. These relationships becomes a more critical part of the film as it progresses toward the actual attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi. Without it, this would become just another war movie. I feel that Bay put a lot of effort on this emotional aspect of the movie, knowing that it is based upon a true event. It was one of the most important to me, personally. With the reputation of Michael Bay, the action and explosions in this movie were nothing short of spectacular and didn't cease to fulfill expectations. The movie portrayed the same anxiety you would feel if you were walking through the streets of Benghazi yourself. The action mixed with the emotional connection you have with the characters of the film allows you to feel appreciation for the experiences that the Navy Seals went through. Although the speed and development of this movie could be considered slow, it leads to a pretty long, dramatic and intense climax. I would consider the climax of the movie from the moment that the attack begins on the Consulate all the way until the end of the movie. There are bits and pieces of adrenaline rushes in the beginning as they go about their business, but none of them compare to the real life action of the attack and defense.I cannot accurately critique this movie without mentioning the amazing job that Michael Bay did in going about filming the most controversial military political topic in recent years. It could have been very easy for him, the actors, producers, etc. to put their own personal political views into the screen write. All in all, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is curious about the real events happening in the world that we live in today. It is informative and I feel very accurate. I will never forget the silence in the full theater as the credits began to roll at the end of the movie. You could legitimately feel the respect and admiration everyone had for these men and all that they sacrificed. The lessons that can be learned from this film are incredible. Forgetting yourself, forgetting who you are because there is something more important than you as an individual. The Seals didn't do these things so that they could receive medals, they did it for the sole reason that they could see their families again, which is the most important thing in this life.", "publish_date": "2016", "category": "Action,Drama,History"}, "index_15": {"review_id": "rw2944616", "reviewer": "alix_no", "movie": "her", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Spike Jonze proves himself to be one of the most promising and creative artists of the 21st century", "review_date": "18 January 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "In a long line of brilliant 2012-13 romance films from Haneke's study of love, time and space in \"Amour\", Linklater's third installment in his growing depiction of a relationship over time in \"Before Midnight\" and Kechiche's widely acclaimed journey of self-discovery in \"Blue is the Warmest Color\". Spike Jonze's \"Her\" closes the year off with an exceedingly creative, charming, relevant and prophetic film. Jonze's creativity is on full display from the moment the film starts, set in a colorful and foreseeable future where technology has just as much control as it does now, but it is we who have become more dependent on it. We see Theodore, brilliantly played by Joaquin Pheonix who brings sensitivity and quirkiness to the role, as a writer at BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com, a company which specializes in \"handwriting\" letters for people that can't properly express themselves. Theodore is in his late 30's, and feels isolated, depressed and disillusioned with relationships after a recent significant breakup with his wife, played by Rooney Mara. Loneliness gets the better of Theodore and he installs an A.I. operating system in the technology he uses. Unsurprisingly, a relationship develops between Theodore and the A.I.This isn't the first film this year dealing with A.I, Bujalski's Computer Chess from this year also dealt with similar themes, but was set around 40 years ago. Through the relationship that occurs between Theodore and his OS, named Samantha played by Scarlett Johansson, Jonze is able to simultaneously reflect the isolating and absorbing effects of technology in contemporary society, while also studying the mutual give and take that is necessary in a relationship and after the relationship. Throughout the film Theodore often denies that he cannot cope with \"real\" emotions and is the only reason why he is now dating an OS. This is somewhat true of his character, he can't properly cope with true emotions and tries to avoid responsibility in a relationship. His response is to back out, Theodore's ex-wife's \"volatile\" emotions can be seen as a main reason as to why the relationship did not work, yet tragically he feels too much of a connection to her (she was his life- long friend) to sign the divorce papers. Theodore's job is to fabricate emotions for other people, which doesn't result in personal consequence to Theodore, although he does seem to have sentimental attachments to some of his clients, also in the beginning of his relationship to his OS he is satisfied with the fact there is no responsibility involved with Samantha. This is not the case with her.Samantha happens to be the most interesting character in the whole film. She is a sentient computer that learns from her experiences and even struggles with thoughts that have plagued mankind forever, such as existence and free will. Again through the relationship in the film Jonze seems to contend that love is the connection between psyches and, if anything, looks are not a large factor in true love. The first love scene that occurs between Theodore and Samantha is portrayed by a black screen. This was a perfect decision by Jonze, we can't see that it is a person with a computer, in that moment they are both thinking and feeling beings that transcend body and are just attracted to each others conscience, physicality is emulated through their passion. This is represented with a black screen and it is the most powerful, sensitive and intimate image in the whole film. As the relationship progresses between the two we see Samantha's fears of Theodore losing interest in her because she lacks a body. A beautiful scene develops where a \"surrogate body\" agrees to be the Samantha's body in the relationship. Theodore has doubts about this of course and unsurprisingly he cannot go through it. The \"surrogate body\" craves to be part of a relationship and is hurt once she leaves the apartment. Not only does this scene reflect the craving people have to be in a healthy relationship but it also makes the point that a body can diminish, even cheapen, a relationship. A fight occurs between the two as Theodore learns that this is a two-sided relationship that has \"real\" emotions and so Theodore must realize that their relationship is \"real\" and requires an element of responsibility. Meanwhile, Samantha begins to view the body as a limitation and this opens up the ideas of omnipotence, alternate theories of love, the metaphysical and whole higher plains of conscience, all of which are eloquently explained in the film. Some of Samantha's logic and ideas begin to transcend human comprehension and it is apparent that the A.I's have surpassed what they have been programmed to achieve.What I found to be the most interesting aspect of the film was societies reaction to the relationships of A.I's and humans, which is complete acceptance. This I believe stems to the fact that the A.I's are fully conscience, albeit non-physical, beings. As for the relationships between A.I's and humans being so widely accepted? I think that Theodore's best-friend Amy, subtly played by Amy Adams, seems to sum this up \"we're only here briefly. And while I'm here, I wanna allow myself joy. So f**k it.\"There is an immense expressionistic beauty in \"Her\" and at times it has the visual boldness of a music video, it goes without saying that the screenplay and direction are brilliant. \"Her\" contains one of the smartest, touching and most beautiful endings in modern cinema. The A.I's leave us, but in someway are still connected. The ending provides an awakening to the introverted nature of technology and how love has the ability to change us, whilst shining a new light on the necessity of relationships, our fears of loneliness and living a life of joy without isolating ourselves or others. I believe that the film does leave the characters with a somewhat more optimistic outlook on life.

With creativity, vision and insight, it depicts a pathetic and depressing society. With strong contrasts, it previews and predicts a heartless future unless we wake up. Congratulations on the Oscar Best Original Screenplay.The basic story line is set in the near future where our protagonist Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) works in a company that helps clients write personal letters to their loved ones. After working solitarily at his work station, Theodore goes home to his huge apartment, playing computer games with a virtual little man or having virtual sex with someone he has never met. He is divorced because he had difficulty telling his feelings. He meets someone new and they hit it off well but he seems to have intimacy issues.Longing for something new in his life, he bought an intelligent operating system, Samantha, (Scarlet Johansson) which has learning abilities. Theodore communicates with Samantha daily and developed a romantic relationship with her. Theodore does not have lots of friends. Amy (Amy Adams) is a neighbor and colleague. After breaking up with her boyfriend Charles (Matt Letscher), Amy also brought a smart operating system whom she treats as a close friend. While the futuristic setting is very interesting and the overall tone of the film is quite warm and bright in pastel color, I feel a haunting coldness and profound sadness. Not that I am an advocate on appearance, but the characters do not seem to care how they look. The beautiful Amy Adams appears with messy hair and almost no makeup. The cute guy in the poster wears an odd-looking thick rimmed glasses with a dense moustache which makes him so much less attractive. But it probably symbolizes an era where we only communicate through electronic devices so we do not need to care our appearance. Theodore's glasses and moustache are also perfect masks for his feelings. However, to me it is quite a turnoff. It seems in that world everything is focused on the intangible and virtual \u2013 like the relationship with an OS.As for the strong contrasts: all the indoor shots are with closed windows. Although Theodore's apartment is spacious and organized, I feel kind of stuffy and lonely. As they go up the apartment, there are shadows of trees on the wall next to the elevator. Things in that world seems very unnatural.Outside on the beach, on the street or in the subway, people are all isolated, or talking to an electronic device. Despite the bright sunshine, people are all absorbed in their own world without connecting to others. Throughout the whole movie the color tone is warm and pastel. But even with the sunshine, the feelings are cold and distant, stuffy and detached. It is just like the technology which is supposed to bring us together but we end up drowning in it and ignoring the people in front of us. Perhaps even in that virtual world people are not connected because they can choose not to respond, or alter their responses. They do not have to listen yet expect others to listen. With an OS it is even worse because they will adapt to your style and say what you want to hear. No wonder relationships fail in the movie - Theodore and Catherine, Amy and Charles, Theo's date and her past men. Even the OS relationships did not make it. They fail because people have refused to listen and compromise. Sad. The director paints a vivid picture of a world where people only care about themselves. They only want their own voice to be heard. I feel tremendously sad about the whole situation because the character are so timid to limit themselves and afraid to take risks. They do not try to put themselves into others' shoes, let alone sharing their feelings. This is even more ironical considering Theo is a writer who helps others voice their feelings. Perhaps even those feelings are fake and he has never gone inside himself to get in touch with his own feelings, not to mention expressing them. The sad part is this type of self-centered disconnection is gradually spreading around us with the proliferation of smart phones, super computers and artificial intelligence. Although it has been said that love can go beyond the physical aspect and more about spiritual and emotional sharing, without physical touch and human warmth, love is never complete. A hug is so much more soothing \u2013 especially when words often got easily misinterpreted. Sometimes the important thing is better left unsaid. Sometimes the more we speak, the more misunderstanding we have. But the body does not lie. Thus it is scary and weird when the human body is controlled by an OS. Her depicts an absurd world where we do not express our feelings anymore and need help from the expert letter writers like Theodore. Ironically these experts cannot connect with other human beings either even though they can write touching letters. There is some revelation in the final scene when they finally find fresh air and see hope with the sunrise after a long and dark night. And hey, Amy is leaning on Theodore.

He falls in love with Samantha, as she calls herself. But can a human have a real relationship with an operating system?I loved being in this world. Jonze creates an incredible world in which he depicts a future that seems not too far away. Bright colours and fashion from our history, such as high waist pants, blends awkwardly well with the advancement of technology showcased here. Not once did I ever think that in our near, or distant future, that we would not achieve what Jonze envisions here.All of Jonze's films are high concept, Being John Malkovich, Where The Wild Thing Are, etc...you'll see a lot of melancholy. Her fits well with his resume, but comes off as a more mature and held back piece. I was invested in the characters, more so than any other film this year. Hell, Her depicts the most honest and real relationship this year and one of them is nothing but ones and zeros. Both characters here are yearning for something more, Theodore, played by Phoenix yearns for connection. He needs to be with someone, but can't emotionally because he still wants to be with his wife. Samantha, voiced by Scar-Jo, yearns to be more than an operating system. She wants to feel, learn, be alive. This film mirrors what these characters go through, which is self discovery. The film doesn't look at the technology as our saviour, nor does it look at it as our curse. It's simply part of our lives and the use of this allows us to examine relationships in a slightly new way. We are disconnected from people due to our devices, but we feel more connected with people because of them. The film manages to make the viewer wrestle with the question, what makes us human? Especially with an AI character and having so many people in the film walk around, in a zombie state, connected to their highly advanced devices. All the people Theodore sees in one way or another mirror him. They all have their ear pieces in, connecting with technology. Phoenix is marvellous here. I'm not a huge fan of him, but I simply loved his performance here. I believed everything he did here and I think it had to do with his eyes. He invokes such sympathy with just his eyes, that Phoenix the actor disappears and Theodore the awkwardly emotionally detached AI lover emerges. He tries to fill his void of loneliness with the technology, as do most of the characters depicted in the film. Amy Adams shows up as a neighbour to Phoenix and best friend. She's here to showcase to us that he is able to talk to and connect with a human being, he's not necessarily this recluse. This is a nice counter to the technology aspect. There is a brother-sister relationship here, which was crucial for the film. This helps us to see the technology as more of a tool for the characters, than simply a good or bad aspect of our future. Her is heartfelt, funny and depressing. If your asking yourself, can a human and an OS have sex? Her answers this question, in a unique way that lets us focus on the sound and not the visuals. Her is without a doubt extremely inventive in the way it approached and handled the typical generic genre about romance and relationships.

Her is a sci-fi romantic drama comedy film about an unconventional love story between an introverted, lonely writer named Theodore and an A.I. who calls herself Samantha.Samantha, a self-aware digital consciousness created from an interactive operating system (OS1), has the ability to communicate in human language, able to learn new things and evolve through experience and self-reflection, is sentient and capable of loving, has a good sense of humour, attentive and responsive, has creative and artistic skills, is compassionate and able to comprehend other people's feelings. Though she only exists through an earpiece and a small, hand-sized computer, her presence is strongly felt, as if she is really side-by-side with Theodore as they go on a date or on the bed together. As the film progresses, their relationship deepens and it raises some disturbing, thought-provoking questions: Is Samantha considered to be a conscious, living being? If she's not, could you name any single cognitive ability humans have that she doesn't? Other than that, the film also provides a thoughtful examination on human relationships in a not-too-distant future that's not that different from us.Is it true that technology can never substitute the authenticity of human interaction?

I'm a sucker for these kinds of things. Maybe it's the Battle Royale and Lord of the Flies fan in me. I did enjoy the first movie. It was a very well done adaptation. However, having read the entire trilogy, I feared that adapting the rest of the material would result in something similar to the books: terrible follow ups. As someone who takes the content of these books and the things that themes and stories they are trying to tell just a bit more seriously than the target age group might, I groaned and moaned throughout the novels, especially the last one. However, the film has done something I didn't think it could do: not suck.That's right, the movie does not suck. In fact, it's actually quite good. So good that it out does The Hunger Games in nearly every way, something that is quite the opposite of the novel. Where the original movie, while good, also came off feeling like it was feeding that tweenie audience it was aimed at, something about Catching Fire feels far more serious and far more mature. The film picks up right where we left off. Katniss and Peeta are on their victory tour, while the rest of the districts are showing signs of civil unrest due to Katniss defiance of The Capitol, that oppressive government regime that forces districts to send their children to die. To send a message to the districts that the capitol is still evil, they devise a new Hunger Games, this time forcing past victors back into the arena. Because what is a Hunger Games movie without the Hunger Games.The first film, at times, felt like it was doing too much to introduce us into this world. Everything felt like some kind of obvious plot detail. While I enjoyed the film, I often felt disconnected to it and the issues it tried to present. There was so much focus on details of the world and the games, that the presentation of the world seemed to take a back seat. Lawrence was the major saving grace, though even she wasn't perfect. All of this has changed. With the games essentially taking a secondary part in the film, there is a stronger emotional connection. It helps that all the actors involved are not only a bigger part of the film but seem to be more comfortable and are much more convincing in their roles. Where the characters of Effie and Haymitch and even Gale seemed purpose driven, with little more than a role to fill, here they feel more fleshed out. They have a greater impact and there is more of an emotional connection, from Haymitch's clear frustration between his contempt for the Capitol and his attempts to keep Katniss and Peeta alive, to Effie's attempt to keep everyone as a team and sure signs that she is struggling with the facts of Katniss and Peeta once again thrown into turmoil.The performances are the primary strength here. They do deliver on the emotion that is necessary to drive this story and don't feel like they are catering just to tweens, with the poorly written love triangle of the novel and the more trivial elements that are apart of the kind of writing that comes with novels aimed at tweens. Catching Fire feels like a serious movie with a serious story to tell. At it's heart is Jennifer Lawrence, who seems like a completely different person here. Since the original movie, as an actor, Lawrence has had several projects and has even won an Oscar. And so, it is no surprise that she feels like she is at an entirely different level. She seems more natural as Katniss and her acting is far more convincing. She comes off as someone who is not only conflicted, but scared. Even so, she remains strong and determined. Much like the first movie, as Katniss, she proves to be among the best of role models for young folk. But beyond the performances, everything just feels elevated. The story has a better focus on the growing revolution that is clearly starting. The themes are more apparent and focused on. Everything feels less obvious and more natural. Gone are introductions to this world and it's elements, replaced by a futuristic vision carried purely by it's story and characters. Even the games are better, with more exciting action, better effects, and better character interaction, helped by a cast of new characters as fellow tributes. I do seem to be gushing about the film, and it's not one I had expected to like nearly as much as I did, but I have to admit it: this was a very pleasant surprise. My fear now is that the next films won't live up to this sequel. But, I will give them more of the benefit of the doubt, considering how much this film blew me away as far as surpassing expectations. As I said in my review for the first film, fans will love this, and non-fans may also find themselves won over.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Action,Adventure,Mystery"}, "index_20": {"review_id": "rw5997407", "reviewer": "rnixon-15663", "movie": "proxima", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "Proxima", "review_date": "15 August 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Proxima\n2020\n12A\nDirector: Alice Winocour\nStarring: Eva Greene, Zelia Boulant, Matt Dillon, Lars Eidinger, Sandra Huller etcOverall rating 71/100Proxima is about a single French mother called Sarah (Eva Green), who is training to become an astronaut and go to mars, but after her daughter struggles with being separated from her, she must decide on her dream or to stay with her daughter. Proxima was a solid drama, but did have issues that held it back.My first few positives would be the cinematography, the connection between the mother and daughter and the themes. The film had fantastic cinematography, with some fantastic shots that took your breath away in some interesting locations that took you into the film really well. The connection between the mother and daughter was also great, the chemistry between both actors here was great, and their relationship was very charming and believable so whenever they were together on screen it just worked. Also the themes expressed were also very good, the film tackled some good issues, including the negative attitudes towards women being as capable as men, but the character of Sarah handled herself very well in these situations which made her very likeable, but also the themes of separation and being the best mother possible was handled fairly well and sensitively.My next couple of positives would be the likeable characters and charming tone. The character of Sarah was very likeable throughout, her relationship with her daughter was very special and explored well, she rose above all the doubts from everyone else, she never gave up and achieved her dreams, becoming an inspiring person to watch, the daughter was also very likeable, to see her confidence grow in terms of her school and social life was great to watch, and how she handled being away from her mum was powerful and often heart-breaking to watch. The film also had a lovely charming tone, it didn't need to have big action scenes or loads of CGI in order to be good, Proxima had a natural and real charm to it's characters and plot.My few negatives would be the un realistic dialogue for the child, pacing issues, and the film not going deep enough with the themes and develop between Sarah and Stella (Zellia Boulant). I thought the dialogue largely at the beginning of the movie was to unrealistic for Stella's character. Her talking about her mum dying and how many kids she wants when she is that young wouldn't really happen in real life and was slightly inappropriate and off-putting. The pacing was fairly slow, throughout the movie it was very slow and the pacing did make me lose interest in the movie from time to time, which was a shame as it made some parts of the movie lose their impact. And finally I felt like they could of went deeper into the themes and development between Sarah and Stella, I felt like the movie largely only touched the surface and played it safe with the issues of being separated from your child, this took away a lot of the emotional impact that the film was trying to deliver, there was just enough development for me to be connected to the characters but not enough for me to be emotionally connected.My final few positives would be the performances, equal amount of time spent on the mother and daughter and the powerful ending. The performances here were very good. Eva Green was fantastic, she showed a lot of emotional depth in the film, and her performance and charm made her character very likeable. Also the performance from Zellia Boulard was also very good, for a child so young she showed a lot of versality and promise throughout, handling all of her emotional scenes very well. I also liked that they managed to spend an equal amount of time on developing Sarah as well as Stella, this made you understand and care for both characters and what they were feeling throughout the movie, so whenever they were together on screen you understood what they were going through emotionally in their heads. And finally the ending was powerful, Sarah and Stella's final meeting was very well done and emotional, and for Sarah to finally take off in the rocket was captivating to watch.Overall Proxima is a well-acted, visually thrilling and sensitively handled drama. That sadly plays it safe with what could have been a more emotionally impactful and more consistently paced film.", "publish_date": "2019", "category": "Action,Adventure,Drama"}, "index_21": {"review_id": "rw6294327", "reviewer": "yesterdayjoe", "movie": "salmon fishing in the yemen", "rating": "1", "review_summary": "No no no \ud83e\udd23", "review_date": "21 November 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "I don't understand \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d why is no one talking about the fact that this is a story of betrayal , selfishness, leaving your wife for a prettier woman cos you're not feeling it?\nThat's what I saw and please let me make my case.\nThe plot from Tom's side: (spoilers)\nTom is more or less that staple repressed, wooden British guy from movies we all know and love (jk haha) who is not emotionally expressive and a bit of a workaholic. He has been married for years and, surprisingly (lol jk) his marriage suffers from lack of emotional connection (What? Why? I hear you exclaim. Ikr?? who knew not expressing emotion could be unhealthy for relationships??) Thankfully (jk again) Mr Tom doesn't make any attempt to address the lack of communication and connection in his marriage, to remember and honour the years of loyalty, love and work that they must have put into the marriage, to be a real friend to his wife and find out what went wrong or to show any loyalty to the reason he married her in the first place. No, he waits for a younger, prettier woman to show up and then leaves her without a word cos chemistry. Literally doesn't even say \"I'm leaving you\" or anything.\nThe same applies to his approach to the second relationship. He doesn't ever (as far as I recall) express a single emotions verbally; just falls in with her as luck permits. There is no sign of any growth and his new flame seems as doomed as the first.\nThe lass's side is no better... I'll keep it short but basically she leaves her man at the most traumatic moment of his life just cos Euan McGregorSo yeah where's. Real love?I think the thing is that this movie runs on \"chemistry\".. on the belief that love is something you find... A feeling that magically leads you to your 'soulmate' or whatever bs\nI don't believe in this. I believe in love as a choice you make. Loving someone means accepting them with all the ebb and flow of what it means to be human. Love is a feeling of being cared about. It's the feeling of safety of knowing that a person will keep accepting you and caring about you as long as they can. Loving someone means making them safe, creating a space where they know they can be loved and accepted.It's not something you \"find\". Stop trying to find love, that's a distraction from loving.\nLove is something you give. And because its unilateral it's risky and scary... But that's why levels and labels exist... To make it a little less risky and a little less unilateral. They mean you can define roughly how much love you are committing to on a bilateral basis... What are the conditions that allow you to cease creating that space and what communication or steps of repair are required before you breach it? That's why dating, engagement and marriage are different.\nAnd marriage is the HIGHEST form of love committment we have.\nAnd that's why breaching it is such a horrendous act of unlove, the literal opposite of true love.\nNot saying that marriages should never ever end (although I do kind of believe that perhaps 99% marriages are happier saved than severed) but surely the most basic foundation of that loyalty, of that commitment is that you will NEVER leave that person for someone elsee and never WITHOUT EVEN TALKING about why with them. This is not love people... Love is a choice it's something you do because you have decided that it makes life better to care about someone else and If you are willing to choose someone over the person you have committed to then what you are doing is not true love. True love is faithfulness....So yeah to met this was a story of giving up on love and the opportunities it creates and choosing instead to trust your future to a few months worth of sexual feelings... Don't buy it people\n\"Let love and faithfulness never leave you, tie them as an amulet around your heart\"\nG'bless :)", "publish_date": "2011", "category": "Comedy,Drama,Romance"}, "index_22": {"review_id": "rw5546558", "reviewer": "yusufpiskin", "movie": "wonder boys", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "Spider-Man & Iron Man meets for literature.", "review_date": "12 March 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Wonder Boys is what critics would label a sleeper. It came out back in early 2000 and tells a fun and interesting story featuring a talented ensemble of entertaining performances by Michael Douglas, Robert Downey Jr. and Frances McDormand, to name a few. The film is based on a novel of the same name by Michael Chabon, and this certainly is the kind of adaptation that makes me eager to track down the source material. While the concept of a writer struggling on his latest novel is hardly an original set up, a well-written screenplay with great dialogue and entertaining characters allows for the film to feel fresh and intriguing enough to keep you invested.Wonder Boys tells the story of an aging author played by Douglas named Grady Tripp. Tripp's novels are widely praised but he hasn't written a book in over five years. He's suffering from an emotional downward spiral, and it's initially implied that he is also afflicted with writer's block. Actually, it's the exact opposite. When he isn't teaching a college creative writing class or indulging in a passionate affair with the married chancellor of the college, Tripp does nothing but write and that is where his problem lies; he can't stop writing. He has spent all those years writing over two and half thousand pages. He can't decide on an ending because the story he's writing refuses to end.Michael Douglas is terrific as Grady Tripp. In the early 90's, Douglas became typecast as the protagonist in a handful of erotic thrillers from that time and seemed to hardly branch out much. It's a shame that a film like Wonder Boys is so often overlooked because I put Grady Tripp next to Gordon Gekko as being one his most memorable characters. There really isn't a whole lot to Tripp, but Douglas effectively makes him feel real and likable. Tripp does share many typical characteristics of past movie characters who were writers. He's eloquent and likable, but also doesn't think very highly of socializing outside of his comfort zone, preferring to avoid most people. He has a quiet disdain for other writers, something I know to be quite common amongst real life writers. My favorite quality of his is how he seems so intent on getting away from everyone, yet still does his part in socializing with people who all seem to like him for him and not just his writing. This is because Tripp is a great guy and most of the people in his life recognize this along with his deliberate detachment from them. He's well meaning and a generous guy at heart, but he can't help but be annoyed at the world around him.Toby Maguire plays James, a student of Tripp's and a fellow brilliant writer who may have greater potential than his mentor. Tripp's relationship with James is as unbalanced as James himself. He seems very withdrawn from the world and suffers from emotional and mental instability, possibly Asperger's. I suggest such because, while displaying a brilliant mind, his demeanor is articulate, yet aloof and childlike. James also has odd obsessions, such as retaining specific knowledge of every documented suicide of a celebrity, what year they died and how. This is one of Toby's better roles and I think he adds enough personality to his character, but I find him to always bring a rather wimpy and overly emotional tone to most of his performances and it kind of bogs his segments down at times, though not enough to take away from everything overall.Frances McDormand is always a treat. She has such a larger than life screen presence, expressing dominance in her voice and presenting herself in a manner that takes ahold of the viewer without being over the top. McDormand always takes control of her scenes in her films because of how convincingly down to earth and believable she is in her roles while being assertive and direct. My main criticism with her is that most of her scenes here feel shoehorned so they can have more of her. She appears throughout the film, yet I can't help but feel that she was still somehow underused, like they weren't sure exactly how to tie her more into the film while it's wrapped up in the other more engaging subplots that are happening simultaneously. I think that's what it is: despite being a terrific screen presence, McDormand is the feature of a subplot that is the least interesting of the story. It doesn't do too much damage to the film. As I previously said, she's always fun to watch, but it is a noticeable flaw nonetheless.Robert Downey Jr. and Katie Holmes top off the main cast. I never found Holmes to be an interesting actress, but she's exceptional, here. She doesn't really have much to do and seems tacked on, but like McDormand, she does her best with she has. Downey is always the scene-stealer and there is no exception in Wonder Boys. While another larger than life screen presence, his role and performance is actually much more subtle than expected. He plays Terry Crabtree, Tripp's editor and close friend. Crabtree is very fun loving, hedonistic and flirtatious. Some of my favorite scenes are with Tripp and Crabtree alone together, because you get to see how their professional and personal relationships coincide. As an editor, Crabtree constantly annoys Tripp about getting his hands on the writer's newest book. Outside of professionalism, the two share a close friendship. It's the kind of friendship two people have that no one else can fully understand nor be apart of. I love this most because I feel it hits close to home with my own relationship with my editor. When you're handing over something as important as a novel to someone you hardly know it's one of the most terrifying experiences. You're allowing this person, a professional, to be the first to read what you busted your ass over for a long time. It's stressful just waiting to hear back from them and get their input because you have no idea of the level of criticism you're waiting on. It's like getting tested for an illness and waiting day after day at home for the results. It's best to find someone you can connect with outside of the professional side of things. When someone is that intimate with your work, you need to connect on more levels and understand each other better so your editor can become invested in what the creation is, whom it's coming from, and what it means to them. You, in turn, must become comfortable enough with a person who is going to possibly tell you that you have to trim off fifty pages or more and take out one of your favorite segments. You can't just hear that from anyone. You have to take that from someone you truly can trust, and that's what Crabtree is to Tripp: the one person he can trust with his writing.There a number of parts to Wonder Boys that I feel will appeal to writers, like the dialogue. It's a solid blend of wit and black comedy, as well as containing occasional terms and quips aimed at writers. One of my favorite lines is when Tripp's voiceover narration describes Q, a fellow renowned author played by Rip Torn, in the party sequence toward the film's beginning:\n\"Q was rich. Q was famous. Q completed a novel every 18 months. I hated him.\"\nIt sort of comes back to what I was saying before about the competitive nature in novelists. It's one thing to admire a fellow writer's work, but when you slave yourself over making something so personal, something that takes months or years to finish, something that you desire to impact the world with, or you can't even get that far, despite your passion and ambitions, it can most often be demoralizing and even disenchanting to associate with someone who produces what you want to accomplish constantly, seemingly without any required discipline.I feel like I watched this at the perfect time, because I'm in the final stages of finishing my first novel before I soon have it published, so there are all these little quirky moments that do hit close to home regarding the process, discipline and mindset of a writer. Even in some of my favorite films about writers, my biggest peeve is when it hardly or doesn't at all show the writer's discipline. It's my main complaint with the hit television show, Californication. Unfortunately, it successfully attempts to glorify the protagonist's decadent lifestyle with little consequence, instead trying to justify that these experiences and shenanigans all play into what makes the character such a brilliant writer, yet we never see him going through the discipline of creating such alleged \"brilliance\". On the other hand, you have films like Adaptation and Barton Fink which not only depict the discipline, but the hardships and mental anguish the process can occasionally cause, most specifically when there is an staggering amount of pressure on your shoulders. Wonder Boys falls in between, instead taking the route of making the writing a background character, but still a character and an important one. It's narrated first person by Tripp, and I think such use of narration helps confirm how integral the writing is in the background of everything else. Outside of that, the film overall follows the antics Tripp falls into, most of which could have been avoided if not for the conflicting inclusions of the overbearing party animal Crabtree, the intriguing yet volatile James, and Tripp's own downbeat and desensitized mindset.Overall, I think Wonder Boys is one of those traditional indie films that will get mixed reactions. Some may find it funny and entertaining, some may find it boring and uninteresting, and others will fall in love with its timeless charm. It's far from a masterpiece and has a few minor flaws, but it's a fun experience throughout and a must watch for fellow writers and those who love movies about them.", "publish_date": "2000", "category": "Comedy,Drama"}, "index_23": {"review_id": "rw5723853", "reviewer": "hi-54168", "movie": "there will be blood", "rating": "5", "review_summary": "What exactly director wants to convey audience ?", "review_date": "10 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "I am very very disappointed with \"There will be blood\" , i initially gone by the powerful title, expected some high intense drama.

So rare is it that a filmmaker has asked so many of the right questions about the nature of relationships and answered just enough of them in just the right ways. And so soul inflating is it to have a film, so outlandish and odd in basic premise, to organically connect with elements of life that we've all worked through in one way or another. The very fact that Jonze still finds the time to effortlessly combine science fiction elements and biting, often hilarious social satire is a testament to the brilliance of this tale and immediately stands not only a love story for our time but one that will only become more resonant as time passes.Her examines love at levels that are simultaneously, and fundamentally, beyond us as human beings and as intimate and natural as we've ourselves experienced. The film doesn't attempt to sell it as merely an illusion \u2013 a made-up fairytale for the deluded \u2013 nor does it spin it into something artificially fluffy and over romanticized. What is at play is as far from the emotions explored in most rom-coms as can be. The way Jonze is able to explore these aspects comes from a multitude of directions, from having our central character of Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling through the all too familiar grind of heartbreak, to his very vocation and on to his friendship with a woman down the hall (Amy Adams). But the way Her really goes beyond the average constraints of a film tackling this subject is with its futuristic setting which blends the technological revolution and everything (good and bad) that journeys along with \"progress.\"In the process of finalizing a divorce, Theodore purchases a new, highly advanced operating system which has the capacity to learn and evolve as it experiences the wonders of the world. Samantha, as she names herself and voiced by Scarlett Johansson, is what springs forth from the software and he immediately becomes smitten not only because of her gentle, inquisitive nature but because they legitimately seem understand one another. From this launching point, and as we see their bond deepen, we are forced to ask ourselves if this love is real or some sort of sick delusion being perpetuated by a heartbroken individual and a piece of gadgetry just doing what it was programmed to do. Yet the questions flood far beyond that as we then contemplate how to truly determine what \"real\" love is and if it has to be between two breathing humans to be true. I could quite literally expand on this very query for another 1000 words but instead I implore you to simply view the film and see for yourself what mindset emerges. On the flip side, Samantha, in all her advancement, struggles with having no physical body finds a divide that cannot be filled growing between them. Also intelligently explored is precisely how an AI such as this may ultimately evolve given the circumstances. As much as this all works as it plays out on screen, so much of this has uncomfortably authentic parallels to real relationships it achieves a whole new level of truthfulness.Then of course there is the whole exploration of society's descent into self imposed isolation, seeking out either artificial or easy emotional connections over the real thing. Her fascinatingly poses the question that this is both a deeply unsettling phenomenon but also a weirdly natural progression. In this futuristic world, flush with odd, vibrant fashion sense (and what appears to be the return of the moustache) the prevalence of technology, be it a sassy holographic video game or what is 24/7 connectivity is not overtly painted as mankind's demise, and while that could turn out to be the case, Jonze doesn't wish to look at it as merely black or white.The performances of what are essentially three main leads are all tremendous, with Phoenix anchoring the film as our flesh and blood protagonist. Married with Jonze's script, we meet with a gentle, sensitive, often introverted man, who within minutes feels like a real flesh and blood person and one we can sympathize with on this odyssey. There is both a na\u00efvet\u00e9 and aura of frustration to this character and despite acting opposite nobody for a great deal of the film, he sells every second. Much of why this on screen relationship works so well is due to Johansson's transcendent voice, as with every word she makes us feel as if Samantha is standing before her eyes. Between this and her brilliant turn in Don Jon, this leading lady has unequivocally shown she is more than just a pretty face. Finally, in a memorable and crucial supporting role Adams as Theodore's long-time friend is the foil to his digital connection and is a character through which some of the film's most important revelations, and further questions, flow.I fear that some may find Her to be too odd, and by looking to the fluorescent colours, focussing on the weirdness or simply psyching themselves out because of the very premise, they will miss what the film is really saying. I know that despite holding my attention throughout I still missed some of what this film was trying to get across. Despite the boldness and high concept at play, Jonze has no pretensions about what he is exploring and as such has crafted one of the most complex and unforgettable love stories ever put to film.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_26": {"review_id": "rw2883952", "reviewer": "benabernathy94", "movie": "the shawshank redemption", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "The Shawshank Redemption (1994), directed by Frank Darabont.", "review_date": "9 October 2013", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "The Shawshank Redemption by Frank Darabont is a classic film that tells the story of a man who overcomes the worst hardship and uses his wit to deceive his authorities. The audience follows a man named Andy Dufrense through both the most terrible, and the most heartwarming events imaginable. As the film progresses, viewers develop a connection with the main characters as suspense builds with each succeeding event (Ebert). Camera angles are important in every movie from romance films to action films to comedies; however in a film that is as emotionally connected as the Shawshank Redemption, camera angles are one of the primary reasons this movie is so renowned. This original story by Stephen King obviously laid a great foundation for Darabont's film; however the film uses different angles to enhance scene suspense\u2014 something that a book cannot do. Frank Darabont's use of specific camera angles throughout the film draws the audience closer to the characters, creating an intimate relationship that makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the best movies of all time. Darabont's choice of camera angle develops a connection between Andy and the audience watching him, making for a much stronger overall film. The first demonstration of brilliant camera angle is the court scene, which shows up early in the film. The camera slowly zooms into his face, revealing his expression of complete shock and awe. This is critical because it gets the audience to realize the pain he is in at the moment. The next moment of noticeable camera work is when Andy is locked into his cell. The camera follows him through the hallway, and then enters the cell with him. The tiny detail to have the camera join Andy in the dark cell connects the audience in a way that literature cannot. At this point, the audience feels the harsh entrapment that Andy feels. The next catastrophic scene in the movie is Andy's rape. The camera does something here that works perfectly at making viewers feel horrible for the protagonist. It shows Andy alone in the laundry room, yet uses the single light source to show only the dark side of his body. As opposed to telling us that he is terribly depressed, the camera angle uses darkness to reveal how he feels. Towards the end of the movie, the camera uses one last movement that truly stands out. Darabont chose to both zoom out and tilt the camera down to give the sensation of rising into the sky. Viewers feel the same sense of freedom that Andy feels that that moment. The view-points of these events give the movie an upper hand to written version. Although the camera doesn't put these events in Andy's point of view, it still manages to make observers feel exactly what he is. Each of these choices in camera movement makes its own unique statement, yet they all bond spectators to Andy by stimulating our intrigue, sorrow, or joy. Camera angle is frequently used to build suspense throughout the movie which draws the audience in and holds them there. The first immensely suspenseful scene is when 'the sisters' rape Andy after beating him up. The camera uses a dolly shot to fade away from the men, while simultaneously moving behind a corner so the audience cannot see all of the horrible events happening to Andy. The rest of the event is left up to imagination, which makes the spectators think about how Andy feels. The camera movement itself is suspenseful in its nature. The next suspense-building scene is the book-shelving scene in the library that Andy took over. The camera shows Andy and Red's conversation from shelf to shelf, making them pause between each of their statements. At this point, they were talking about Andy's cunning in taking over the warden's financial situation. Each time they move, the camera pans with them, forcing them to pause their conversation, which obviously leads the audience to anticipation\u2014wondering what will be said next. Another great example is Red's journey out of the Shawshank Prison. The point of view switches over to Red, however the camera's talent of building suspense remains the same. Brooks left the prison before Red, and took a journey through town to a halfway house, where he hangs himself, leaving a note: 'Brooks was here.' Once Red is released, he follows Brooks' exact journey from location to location, and then etches into the walls next to Brooks' note 'so was Red.' The camera focuses on the writing on the wall so the audience cannot see whether or not Red hung himself just like Brooks. After this, the director utilizes pedestal movement to slowly reveal the rest of the room, and it is discovered that Red did not hang himself, relieving the audience instantly. In this instance, the camera helped the movie build suspense where the book version would not be able to. After this scene, as the movie is finishing up, the audience is taken to the orchards with Red, in search of the note Andy left for him. This is one last moment of suspense because of the camera angle. It tracks Red along the stone wall, but never shows us what he sees, leaving the viewer's asking 'will he find the special package or not?' Resolving the situation is in Red's hands, and the camera helps to build suspense until he finally sees the unique rock. Often, words with a story can create enough suspense to draw a group of people in; yet adding unique viewpoints will maximize the anticipation in most any movie.Though The Shawshank Redemption never earned any Oscars, it received seven nominations for multiple awards including best picture.This movie has not received all of the popular accolades it deserves, yet that doesn't take away from its brilliance.", "publish_date": "1994", "category": "Drama"}, "index_27": {"review_id": "rw6388296", "reviewer": "HanShotFirstGR", "movie": "star wars: episode iii - revenge of the sith", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "The best in the Prequel trilogy..

As Obi-Wan pursues a new threat, Anakin acts as a double agent between the Jedi Council and Palpatine and is lured into a sinister plan to rule the galaxy.Analysis:After 2 very underwhelming movies for the franchise, the third one in prequel trilogy was a huge step towards the beloved Star Wars quality we all wanted. After a boring Episode I and a kinda cringey Episode II, Episode III brought the balance to this trilogy. By fixing most of the problems that were spotted in the previous movies and completing the overall vision at the same time without sacrificing the continuity, Episode III for a large amount of people is one of the best in the whole saga and I can see why.The first improvement you can easily spot is Anakin. After the cheesy approach on Attack of the Clones, the creepy looks at Padme, his weird flirting that felt way too unappealing and Hayden Christensen's uninspiring perfomance, this movie was a huge leap to success for this character. First of all, Hayden's performance is way more mature in this one, he seems to be way more connected with the character, he lives this journey, he's more natural and the result is clearly a huge success, so he deserves some credits for the success of this film. Also, the story is way better in this episode, not only they fixed the pacing and theme problems, but they managed to bring the most emotional and dark Star Wars movie too, making the original trilogy even more important and satisfying for this world. This movie feels like it was written by a different person, a more mature, more interesting, more entertaining and more emotional experience that excels as a movie in general not just as a part of Star Wars.Another big win is the chemistry between Obi-Wan and Anakin. While, Episode II was the rough years of Master-Padawan relationship and conflict, Episode III is the peak of their friendship and starts in a point where ranks and knowledge mean way less to them than the strong bond that has been developed between them, Anakin is way more comfortable with himself and does a better job following what Obi-Wan was trying to teach him back then, making their relationship more valuable as two adults that live and fight as brothers.Ewan McGregor's performance is once again amazing, he is clearly the only man who could portray Obi-Wan, he doesn't try to connect with the character, he casually acts as him like he's a part of his personality. He is the best character of this trilogy and Obi-Wan is a gift to cinema thanks to Ewan's passion on making him memorable.The whole theme is also something new to this franchise, an innovative well-executed idea that made this movie a fan favourite. A dark and impactful film that not only delivers a crucial story for the saga, but also manages to combine a political drama with romance and action, every choice, every fight, every small detail has a major impact for the entire galaxy. Through this movie, Star Wars took a step forward and showed the entire world of cinema that it is way more than a goofy adventure, it's a complete and meaningful story of human nature covered in fancy fights and cool spaceships.Despite all these amazing elements that make this movie great, there are some that hold it back from being among the best in the saga or even a masterpiece for modern cinema in general. The main problem is the chemistry between Padme and Anakin which is non-existent. It's really a missed opportunity that the couple whose fate is conected to the galaxy's feels forced and fake. It's not clear if Hayden and Nathalie fail to bring out the appropriate chemistry or director's orders aim for this result, but without a doubt this is a big flaw and a major dissppointment for the fans. Another one, that continues to be as annoying as in previous films is the dialogue. Although it is way more natural and has been improved since Attack of the Clones, it's still too wooden and unappealing, cringey lines that ruin the atmosphere, bad one-liners and irrational discussions are just a few of the many problems that dialogue causes.There are flaws, enough that you can't ignore them but they don't really matter a few minutes before this movie ends. Everything we believed in, everything we loved, everything we stood for, leads to this, an amazing emotional and one of a kind finale. Visually, emotionally and storywise this ending does more than anyone could hope for, it's more than just a great sequence, it's the entire essence of Star Wars in a few minutes.Conclusion:For many fans this movie is a masterpiece, among the best movies in the franchise and even if that's not the case with me, I still appreciate and love this one for the deep drama it is, a dark emotional story beyond any imagination, a story people need to hear and an important experience for everyone to have. It isn't flawless or perfect but it will leave you the perfect feeling, the one that makes you understand why people love these movies.Rating: 8.5/10", "publish_date": "2005", "category": "Action,Adventure,Fantasy"}, "index_28": {"review_id": "rw6065136", "reviewer": "msbreviews", "movie": "mulan", "rating": "4", "review_summary": "Mulan is the most disappointing remake Disney has done so far and by far...", "review_date": "5 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you might now, this remake is one of my most anticipated movies of 2020 (list here). I've at least \"liked\" almost every remake Disney has delivered so far, so I was incredibly excited that 1998's Mulan was getting the same treatment. Niki Caro made it clear this would be an entirely different version of the story we all know and love. A more realistic take on the Chinese tale, one that removes all songs and fan-favorite characters like Mushu, which instantly impacted expectations, varying tremendously from person to person. People who would love a remake quite similar to the original will enter the film already slightly discouraged. However, to everyone who complained about Disney copying their original IP, Mulan might be their best chance to like a remake from the studio.In my opinion, a remake should have a bit of both. It must keep the original's essence and message while delivering something that distinguishes it from the former. Any remake must always prove the reasons behind its existence. It must have something that makes the viewers think: \"I like this part that's not in the original\". Aladdin has a new arc given to Jasmine. Beauty and the Beast provides Beast with a better-developed storyline. Even The Lion King, a remake that convinced many people to call it a shot-for-shot (it isn't), presents a groundbreaking visual experience that's incomparable to the original. Therefore, I was genuinely hyped for Mulan and what Niki Caro could bring with her more pragmatic cut...I can't deny it: I feel extremely disappointed. In my review of the original movie, I mention how epic and cinematic it feels. It was one of the aspects I looked forward to the most in this new version. Despite the beautiful set design and some painting-like shots, this is the first time a Disney's live-action remake loses to its original regarding its visuals. The 2D animation from more than twenty years ago feels superior in every single aspect. There's only one shot in the entire remake that I would put in the original, and I bet it would look and feel a lot more emotionally significant. The action sequences are unimaginative and incredibly disjointed. Except for a few great war moments, most action scenes are packed with excessive CGI, a badly employed HFR (high frame rate), and overediting.In fact, the editing (David Coulson) is weirdly overworked throughout the entire runtime, cutting too much and omitting sequences that were supposed to significantly impact the narrative. From character-defining moments to simple connections between scenes, it feels like the film is hiding something. I constantly needed to rely on my knowledge of the original to remember why certain moments are meaningful to a character or to the story itself because this remake straight-up removes these moments without replacing them with something else. Even in chronological terms, it's clumsily put together, jumping from location to location without actually showing the characters moving from one place to another.Finally, as my last remark on the technical aspects, Harry Gregson-Williams' score is partially also a letdown. Like the rest of the movie, there are some nice touches and lovely homages to the songs everyone cherishes, especially Reflection. I had already mentalized myself to ignore the absence of songs because I believed Harry would find a way to replace them with a similarly grand score that I would definitely enjoy. However, Mulan's score fails not only to elevate a single battle sequence but also to deliver that cinematic atmosphere that I was looking forward to so much. I didn't get chills during the entire film. It didn't transform any big character moments. Maybe watching it on IMAX instead of at home might improve my opinion, but I doubt that.Story-wise, it's a mixed bag for me. Niki Caro promised a more realistic take, totally different from the original, and she undoubtedly accomplished that. This is the furthest from the original any Disney remake has been, by far. From the replacement of characters to an overall change to the main narrative, Mulan is more faithful to the original Chinese tale than the 1998's flick, but that doesn't mean it's better, much on the contrary. The essence and message are there but told through a distinct perspective, which some people will find hard to accept, especially hardcore fans of the original movie. However, I do believe that Hua Mulan still carries the characteristics that made me care about her.Her courage and bravery to go to war in order to save her father from certain death. Her love and devotion to her family, who she wants to honor. Hua Mulan doesn't want to just be the wife of some random man nor be imprisoned by dated stereotypes. This is all in the remake but told through the lenses of a protagonist who already has everything she needs to lead a nation. This is the main difference character-wise, but one that doesn't affect the nature of the original. However, it impacts the remake itself. While all of this sounds amazing, Mulan sort of contradicts itself by making her main character feel unique and different from everyone else, distancing her more from people than actually embracing her.Like I already mentioned above, this is an entirely altered version of the story everyone knows. I do welcome every change made, including the removal of Mushu, Cri-Kee, and all of the singing. However, if something's removed, something else has to replace it in some shape or form. Once again, I have mixed feelings. Some additions, like the introduction of Chi and the witch Xian Lang (Gong Li), are refreshing but poorly developed throughout the runtime. The vital energy force is connected to my issue with the \"be yourself\" message, while the character not only follows a predictable arc, but it diminishes Bori Khan's (Jason Scott Lee) menacing presence.The ending feels remarkably underwhelming as well. Not only the climactic fight between Hua Mulan and Bori Khan fails to live up to expectations, but it's executed in a visually disheartening fashion. I expected this remake to feel grand, magnificent, epic, and cinematic, just like its original or even better. It's far from that. The acting could also be better. Liu Yifei is fantastic as Hua Mulan, Yoson An offers a subtle yet efficient interpretation of Chen Honghui, and the actors who portray Yao (Chen Tang), Ling (Jimmy Wong), and Chien-Po (Doua Moua) are also amusing. However, Donnie Yeng as Commander Tung and Jet Li as The Emperor are embarrassingly bland, while Jason Scott Lee is visually perfect casting as the main villain, but he's not able to shine.In the end, Mulan is the most disappointing remake Disney has made so far and by far. Even though Niki Caro delivers the realistic, distinct take that was promised, its execution feels inferior to the original animated film in every single way. Technically and visually, it's the first live-action remake from the respective studio that loses in almost every aspect to the 2D animation from more than twenty years ago. The 1998's movie is far more epic and cinematic than its remake. The disjointed editing is overworked to the point of omitting and skipping through character-defining moments. The action scenes are packed with unnecessary CGI that takes away from the war set pieces, which also look small in scale. The musical score isn't able to replace the songs from the original, overflowing the film with a weirdly empty feeling. Despite Liu Yifei delivering a good performance as the protagonist as well as a few of her colleagues, the acting is pretty mediocre overall. Story-wise, it's a mixed bag. It's an undoubtedly unique version, the furthest that a Disney's remake has ever been from its original, which will instantly upset some and please others. I praise the courage and bravery in producing such a different version. There are dozens of new additions that I sincerely appreciate, but their execution lacks emotional impact, ultimately being decisions inferior to the ones of the original. The message and essence of the original are still present through another perspective, which is the best compliment I can give to an otherwise quite disappointing remake...Rating: C-", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Action,Adventure,Drama"}, "index_29": {"review_id": "rw2901582", "reviewer": "Michael_Elliott", "movie": "all is lost", "rating": null, "review_summary": "A Wonderful Achievement for a Legendary Actor", "review_date": "8 November 2013", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "All is Lost (2013) **** (out of 4) Robert Redford reaches a wonderful career achievement playing a man who wakes up in the middle of the Indian Ocean realizing that the boat he is on is sinking and he's all alone in the world without much hope for survival. ALL IS LOST is quite an achievement on so many levels but what's so remarkable here is the performance of Redford. The actor has had a legendary career in some terrific movies but this film here really gives him the toughest role and it's quite remarkable seeing him work it. I thought his performance was certainly the emotional connection to the events we're seeing and it should be noted that he's only given a couple lines of dialogue throughout the picture. By having no dialogue at all it's impossible for him to tell us what he's thinking or feeling so instead we're given an actor all alone and having to show these emotions and thoughts without words. I've always said that silent film acting would be the hardest thing to do and in many ways that's what Redford must do here. He sees the damage to the boat and the dire situation he's in. We don't hear what he thinks is happening but we can certainly feel it. He finds himself in the middle of a violent storm. Once again, no words are spoken but we can feel and sense everything he does. Redford certainly does a marvelous job here and the film's success certainly needed such a strong performance. A lot of credit also goes to director J.C. Chandor who manages to build up such a connection to this character that it's quite remarkable at how well it works. There are so many emotions in this story and needless to say, it grows more and more depressing as the film plays out and just the pure impact of these emotions is hard to put into words but it's certainly something most movies never reach. Another major player in the film's success is the cinematography by Frank G. DeMarco and Peter Zuccarini. The camera work really puts you in the middle of the sea and you really do start to feel as if you're out there with Redford The music score by Alex Ebert is marvelous and really adds a lot of punch.

From its teaser, Tenet played like a parody of Christopher Nolan clich\u00e9s; the high concept with mind-bending visuals, large action set pieces, and a booming soundtrack. Admittedly, it was the first time it seemed like the cracks were showing and I distinctly felt like I've already seen the film.Christopher Nolan's brilliance is his firm grasp of what only cinema can do. He inherently understands that cinema isn't a story that is told or just seen, but something that has to be viscerally experienced. It's in that experience where he builds surprise in his stories.The most prominent example from my memory is how the Tumbler was introduced in Batman Begins. When the audience first sees the Tumbler, we are verbally told by Morgan Freeman that it is a bridging vehicle that can tow cables and make rampless jumps. That piece of information is understood and easy to picture, but has no visceral impact in that expositional moment which only acts as a setup. Later when you see the Tumbler ramming over cop cars and actively jumping through rooftops, your jaw drops.There are a lot of jaw-dropping cinematic set-pieces littered through Tenet designed with that mindset; an opening action sequence in an opera theater, a plane crashing into an airport that is done for real (move over, Face/off), a highway car chase, and more. The action sequences are technically impressive; for example, the actors and stuntmen trained to perform their fights backwards which is mind-blowing to see. Even amidst all the visual spectacle, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography conveys a realistic immediacy as if the events are unfolding before you.Where Tenet drops the ball is in how it conveys its exposition. Inception spends its first hour teaching the audience the rules of the dream world and uses visuals and cinematic language to reinforce the audience's understanding so they can take part in the more complicated schemes and gambits that Leonardo DiCaprio's team comes up with later in the film.Tenet is much more eager to get going and spends considerably less time teaching its science fiction concept to the audience along with very little reinforcement throughout. Much of the issue is all the exposition is given in dialogue and it's a chock full of made-up sci-fi terms and spy code words that craves some cutaway visuals to help explain what's being said. Add that with a roaring soundtrack (scored by Ludwig Gor\u00e4nson this time) that gobbles up the entire sound spectrum and what's left is a hazy elusive experience that leaves you cold.John David Washington has the presence of an old-fashioned action movie star, just a tough silent customer you don't want to contend with. Both his onscreen presence and physicality play very well to his role as The Protagonist (it's incomprehensible why Nolan couldn't have given his character a real name as if the movie wasn't complicated enough). I think Washington will become a movie star after Tenet, maybe in some actor-led action franchise on the horizon.Robert Pattinson was good as Washington's sidekick who seems to be having fun spouting the sci-fi dialogue with a playful facetiousness which reminded me of Tom Hardy's Eames in Inception. Kenneth Branagh plays his villain like a slightly campy Shakespearean version of Gary Oldman's Russian villain from Air Force One, the epitome of 90's action villains.Elizabeth Debicki has the job of being the film's emotional anchor and tries her best to pour life into an otherwise underwritten role as someone Washington's spy has to save. Added together with the labyrinthine plot and all the math that's required figuring out whether what you're seeing is forwards or backwards, it was difficult to emotionally connect to any of these characters and care about Elizabeth Debicki and her plight.The lack of an emotional connection to the characters also means there is no theme driving the story or a bigger question for the audience to ponder about and chew on. In Memento, it was revenge. In The Prestige, it was obsession. In Inception, it was guilt. Even though the theme seems like it's about time itself, Tenet is just an action film and it just does not hook me on the same level.Watching Tenet gave me a glimpse of what old age might feel like. The complicated dialogue hindered by its pounding soundtrack was inaudible. The story became increasingly harder to follow as if the plot structure suddenly decided to play a game of hide-and-seek with my brain. By the end, I was too slow and tired to follow what was happening and just wanted to go home and go to sleep.In the past, Christopher Nolan has shown great timing on the audience's brainpower and knew when to give exposition whenever our movie RAM was running low. Remember the scene in Inception where Ellen Page asks, \"Wait, whose dream are we going into again?\" That was so perfectly timed. In my theater, people burst out laughing because it was exactly what the entire audience was thinking. So there are really no excuses. Christopher Nolan knows Tenet is too much but supposes the audience will get it eventually on a rewatch. I feel half-cheated by this.People are talking about how this movie needs to be seen more than once. I heard it being murmured countless times in the men's room in the cinema after the film ended. The marketing campaign even seems to be selling that idea.Someone tried to talk me into joining a Ponzi scheme once when I was seventeen and I did not take the bait then. If an idea is the most resilient parasite, then I am Cillian Murphy's militarized subconscious projection with an automatic weapon holding the fort and still fighting the good fight. No, I do not buy into the idea of rewatching Tenet, at least not without a pause button.After the movie upon discussion, I could recite the plot, no problem. The clue is in the film's palindromic title, which is the equivalent of spelling \"race car\" forwards and backwards. What would only be clarified on rewatch is working out pure logistical issues, figuring who was when during which flip flop moment. With no emotional anchor or narrative clarity or theme, and even though I'm enjoying the water cooler discussions with friends and colleagues, Tenet is not fun enough to revisit. By default, this automatically puts Tenet at the bottom of Christopher Nolan's filmography.\"Don't try to understand it. Feel it,\" says Cl\u00e9mence Po\u00e9sy's scientist Barbara during the film's opening inversion training sequence. Well, Barbara, I tried. I really tried to feel Tenet, but in actuality, it seems it was more important to understand it.

However, it has since been created into a Broadway production and a movie, more than once. This movie stands out from all of the others for having a story that contains so much emotion. Its themes range from love, to fear, to hope, to anger, and to power. As a movie viewer, one will experience all of the emotions along with the character and by the end of the production the viewers are left feeling refreshed. This is an outstanding musical drama, because the acting is real and believable and the cinematography is incredible. In this 19th century French film, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) plays a man who has been in jail for 19 years, only for stealing a loaf of bread. After being released, he soon finds himself not liking the person he is becoming and sees the errors in his ways. The film fast forwards eight years later, and he is a sophisticated factory man, and the town's mayor. However, he is being hunted for breaking his parole by, the policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe). As this goes on, the viewers come across Fantine (Anne Hathaway), who has lost her pride to the point of despondency to pay for her child Cosette (Amanda Seyfried), who is staying with a stingy inn-keeper and his selfish wife. During the film, Jean Valjean comes to be the care taker of Fantine's daughter, Cosette. Throughout the movie, the viewers see how the characters interconnect with one another and those connections then build up the intensity of love, hope, redemption, forgiveness and revolution. These passions are shown thoroughly through the actors because they create an authentic emotion for the audience to get sucked into. Many of the actors that are in this film are known for their acting, yet in this film viewers see a new side of each actor. One of the unique characteristics of this film is the actors never lip-synced. As they were filming, they were also singing live, and because of this more emotion was brought out in the movie. This may have made the singing rougher and seem raw. However, this does not demean the story line of this film. On the contrary, it heightens the believability, creating a raw emotion from each character. Another way the actors got into character was giving up something personal. During a scene, Hathaway sells her hair and during the production of the film it was actually cut off. This shows that she is portraying the sincere emotion of losing her hair. Another part that enhances this movie's production is the cinematography. The director, Tom Hooper, chose many of the scenes to be close ups which helps to capture the emotion in the character's faces for the audience to see. Since the camera gets in close proximity, one is able to see every emotion vividly. The viewers are able to see the hope that still remains and the loss that will never leave their eyes. The lighting enhances their emotion as well. The director made sure to show the darker scenes to correlate the despair people have, especially when showing all of the poverty that France had at the time of the film. However, at the same time, he would show lightness and almost a glow in the actors face to show the hope they were searching for. Les Miserables is a fantastic musical because it creates a feeling of hope inside of the viewers. This movie does the difficult task of having a wide array of emotions such as anger to happiness, love to heartbreak, and grief to hope. Nevertheless, the viewer's feel the experience of each emotion and empathy for that character is held in your heart.

There is no flaw in this truth or in the people who do or do not find themselves moved by the art in question- it just is.I do believe there are people who more intuitively and naturally reflect inward, on death, on life- the meanings of all these things; it is a natural state for them. And I believe there are people as equally blessed and cursed to not think very deeply on these matters. I think this film will find a comfortable home in the hearts of the former. Now, of these \"inner seekers\"- I believe you have all variations of folks- those that seek deeply and find beauty, connection, and great joy. There are those seek deeply and find isolation, grief, and deep wells of sadness. There are those who find some semblance of balance between the two. I myself lean more towards connection, and subsequent joy because of that\u0085 I found this movie to be profoundly moving- on almost a primordial level- and I believe- in a hopeful way. Don't get me wrong, I cried many times during the movie and didn't want to leave the theater when the film was finished. I held back the wells of whatever it was that was welling up in me until I got to my car and then unloaded some body shaking tears. It wasn't sadness, though\u0085 it was\u0085 something else. I don't really know yet. One thing I do know is that all of Kaufman's films seem to affect me in this manner. After the initial viewing- I know distinctly how the movie has affected me emotionally- I can FEEL it. I am not capable of defining that feeling, or explaining why that feeling has erupted (it is clear to everyone that his plot and content are generally all over the board and it usually takes several viewings to pull any real intellectual analysis from them)- but I certainly am conscious of something new and fresh happening inside my emotional hard wiring. I find that a phenomenal feat in the face of a sea of art which relies on very standardized ways of pulling it's consumers in emotionally. Do you remember how you felt after Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? I remember walking out and feeling very hopeful about the nature of love- in a whole brand new way. Not in the contrived, standardized Sleepless in Seattle kind of way\u0085 not to judge that- but there is something amazing about an artist who can make you feel things you are not sure you've felt before. That, to me, is authentic art. This really isn't about valuing one thing more than another- just offering great respect to someone who has taken your mind and heart to places it hasn't been before. It is nice to visit those old comfortable haunts, but this\u0085 well, like all of Kaufman's films- will take you somewhere entirely new- if you are predisposed to that kind of wandering.", "publish_date": "2008", "category": "Drama"}, "index_33": {"review_id": "rw5556800", "reviewer": "xx-slay-n-xx", "movie": "frozen ii", "rating": "5", "review_summary": "The Problem With Elsa", "review_date": "17 March 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Elsa is simply a bland, lifeless shell with the sole purpose of singing Let It Go and acting as a plot driver for Anna, Kristoff and Olaf. She has no desires, no emotions, no humanity. I exaggerate a bit, but it feels like that at times. Her character is minimal and Idina Menzel doesn't really have the voice acting ability to make something from nothing. And you see, this isn't necessarily a problem. In the first Frozen film, she was barely on screen and the focus was mostly on the adventure of Anna and her sidekicks. Elsa's lack of energy was masked by the overall plot and the performances from the real stars. Elsa was more of a device rather than a character, and she served that role well. She caused the ice storm, and Anna fixed that. She was the problem that every film needs to have as the integral latching-on point to give a concise and exciting narrative.But in the second film, things fell apart. Why? Because they made Elsa the main character. Anna was shunted off to her own pointless side-quest with Olaf, and Kristoff was...wait where was Kristoff? Did he even appear in the movie? He was entirely forgettable except for the 80s power ballad (which I admit was pretty awesome, actually) and the single cleverly disguised sex joke at the end that is mandatory in every Disney cartoon. Elsa was front and center for the whole movie. She simply does not have the depth of character or the relatability to hold the film up on her own, and so the story feels flat and lifeless compared to the first.We can simply compare the two main songs from the first and second movie. \"Let It Go\" is a release from responsibility, a rebellious ode to freedom and escape from scrutiny. Thus, Elsa becomes the antagonist (though not really the antagonist, more like the \"problem-maker\"). This role suits her as she can step aside to let the other characters save her and her kingdom. \"Into The Unknown\" is a song full of reservations. \"I've had my adventure, I don't need something new\" she says in the song. She is a main character who actively wants to avoid interesting developments. How can we be expected to attach ourselves to a character who doesn't even want to be the star in their own movie? If we are to put ourselves in her shoes, then the following events of the film are an unhelpful nuisance, not an enterprise of self-growth and accomplishment.The other Disney stars of this similar era make Elsa seem like a tired schlup. Moana is drawn to \"the line where the sky meets the sea\", an unquenchable thirst for exploration on the great blue waves. Judy Hopps is a precocious overachiever who will stop at nothing to succeed beyond expectations. Rapunzel could have been just a lovely damsel in distress but was witty and, at times, bad-ass. And Elsa is a queen who doesn't want to be a queen on an adventure that she never wanted to go on.I get it, Elsa had a traumatic past. She was locked up in her room for years and not allowed to see her only sister and companion in this world. The journey of the first and second movie is therefore how she deals with her trauma and copes. She is awkward and nervous, reserved and not outgoing. A character does not need to be exuberant or over-dramatic to be entertaining. But there needs to be at least an element of relatability. Elsa doesn't have nearly enough screen time or lines between the first movie and the first 20 minutes of the second to really warrant this connection with the audience, so when she sets off on her own adventure, we have nothing to work with.For me, one of the parts that best illustrates the failure of Elsa's writing and her overall character is her relationship with Anna. It is in every way a canoe with one paddle, totally one sided and can't function. On one hand we have Anna who expresses deep yearning for her sister's love, a quirky familiarity and passion. From Elsa we get a clinical, monotonous response. Their relationship is so awkward and strained that I was physically cringing at animated characters. I know they didn't grow up together, but they spent the last three years living together. I would expect some sort of camaraderie by now. There are two scenes which really highlight this. The first is the scene where they are playing Charades and the second is the heart-to-heart they have near the very end of the film.In the charades scene there is a happy family playing a fun game together...and there is an odd one out, a fifth wheel who just feels out of place. Never mind the fact that she has something else on her mind (which comes near the end of the scene), there is absolutely no sign of emotional connection here. It goes well beyond the socially awkward type which is Elsa's shtick into the unconnectable. I want to empathize with her, but I simply cannot.The scene near the end, where Elsa explains the narrative conclusion and abdicates her throne, is even worse. This is supposed to be a moment of summative character growth and understanding. It loses all power because of Elsa. It feels like Anna is talking to a robot rather than her sister. It feels like Spock trying to explain something trivial to Captain Kirk. The problem is that Spock has earned that right to monotony and coolly calculated wisdom through a deep character backstory and a dearth of episodes to lean on. Elsa has none of this, but we are suddenly expected to take her as an all-knowing arbiter of the will of nature. It's either trite or it's snooze-inducing, take your pick.Maybe it's on purpose that they made Elsa an ice queen (yes, I know they couldn't call it Frozen otherwise). She is cold and placid, frozen to the core. The metaphor went overboard and became self-fulfilling. The cold was supposed to be the overarching metaphor that builds the world and characters, but instead it just froze my interest.I have to admit that Elsa has some cool moments. When she is an ice-wielding superhero, that's awesome. When she is fighting with the ocean and the spirit of the water, it is totally cool and engaging. That is what I want her to be all the time. She is the secret weapon that the gang can pull out at any moment to defeat the baddies. When she has a lot of dialogue and when the story hinges on her emotional exploits, that's where the film goes wrong. With a different focus, this film could go from average to pretty good.You know what's just the real kicker though? Disney always wins. No matter what, they come out on top. They can make a movie with a convoluted plot and sub-par main character and they win anyway, because they know their audience so well and they control the marketing. Frozen II is the 10th highest grossing movie of all time (at the time of writing this) and out-grossed the original. It is the second highest grossing animated film of all time. Maybe they don't need to spend the time making a compelling character with an interesting personality and character growth. Maybe they just need a generic placeholder that can be the face to plaster on toys and games, and they can keep putting out the same thing over and over. The recent success of their remakes and their ever-growing media empire certainly indicates this is true.", "publish_date": "2019", "category": "Adventure,Animation,Comedy"}, "index_34": {"review_id": "rw2995201", "reviewer": "Mcfarlanej", "movie": "the young and prodigious t.s. spivet", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "Sweet and charming", "review_date": "9 April 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "It's easy to fall in love with this tale of the ingeniously, slightly magical story of The Young and Prodigious T.S.

Without being presenting as being too intelligent or arrogant and thus putting the audience off. He's both intelligent and likable, and modest too. Whilst charming and witty it's not exactly funny. Then again it's not a comedy. Now this is not a bad thing, as the film works really well for it. The film comes across as this little humble tale of something possibly real, and emotionally touching, whilst being both enlightening and saddening at times. Nothing like 'Home Alone' or any of those sorts of movies. It's just that I can see how to some, the film may be perceived as being somewhat bland, and in some ways yes, but for the most part no. You really will become greatly involved all the way throughout the movie. The cinematography is brilliant, as you would expect from Jean Pierre Jeunet, director of Amelie and Micmacs etc. It accompanies the magical style and point of view that T.S. Spivet holds, without overpowering the film as a whole. The screenplay is brilliant, really working off of the original books. In addition, every character feels essential. It doesn't waste time with characters unneeded, and feels much more compact for it. The story has many a twist and turn in store for you and will make you well up inside. The reason mainly being in the ending, where there is a major plot point, and we can feel every emotion possible from every single character, because by the end, you really have grown to love them. You've connected with them, and you feel for them. Slightly strange at times and brilliantly acted, to which, I see great things in-store for Kyle Catlett (T.S. Spivet). T.S. Spivet is definitely one to watch with the entire family. Prepare yourselves, hearts will be uplifted. There's only two flaws with this movie... some people may feel like it's not \"entertaining\" or \"funny\" enough, to which it's not supposed to be... It's touching, brilliant and a really adventure, (And do you know what, it's a little bit funny too). The second flaw, is that some of the characters are a little bit of a caricature, especially with the stereotypical police officer and Two Clouds just being thrown in for good measure, where they just act as fillers, however, as fillers go, they're still really good.Final Grade: A-Not quite Jeunet's best work, but it does the trick.

Not that many people watch her movies, which doesn't quite allow me to draw a conclusion about what the general public thinks about her, but there's a clear tendency for overall positive feedback when a lot of people put their eyes on one of her pieces instead of just a couple of hundreds. Therefore, I was really intrigued by Kajillionaire's synopsis, and the cast is interesting, to say the least. So, does Miranda conquers one more fan, or am I too stubborn to convince?Her unconventional filmmaking style definitely captures my attention, but it's her incredibly subtle character development that ultimately wins me over. Evan Rachel Wood's Old Dolio doesn't know how to live or what life truly is. She doesn't understand or feels fundamental human interactions due to the loveless parenting that accompanied her throughout her entire life. She only knows how to steal, cheat, and live a life outside of the law. She believes life is meaningless and that a massive earthquake will change everything. So, Old Dolio is an easy character to root for and to connect with when things don't work out as she expects. It's impossible not to feel sorry for her. I constantly felt sad and even uncomfortable when she was emotionally suffering.Evan Rachel Wood (Westworld, Frozen II) offers a unique interpretation of someone with this kind of personality, even changing her voice tone, delivering a notably layered performance. Evan and Gina Rodriguez (Melanie) share impeccable chemistry, a vital component in the main plot. Their characters create such an emotional bond that any sane and educated viewer will understand where their relationship is driving towards. This friendship is treated in such a respectful and realistic manner from Miranda July that I felt extremely pleased by everything surrounding it. It's undoubtedly the primary source of entertainment.However, it's Gina Rodriguez (Annihilation, Scoob!) who genuinely elevates the whole story. Honestly, in my opinion, it's her career-best performance. With tiny, little facial expressions, she's able to clearly transmit to the viewer everything Melanie is feeling. She's introduced at the right time, just when the film needs a push. Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger are also outstanding, especially the former who gives his character a few unexpected, emotionally powerful moments. Both parents are as cold and rigorous as they could be, teaching her daughter how to survive without any affection instead of how to live and be filled with love.Miranda July writes a compelling narrative, packed with dramatic sequences, but also with quite a bit of humor. She employs a somewhat slow pacing, which doesn't always work in favor of the movie. In fact, if it wasn't for Gina and Evan's incredibly captivating interactions, Kajillionaire would suffer much more from the family's scamming business, something that quickly loses my enthusiasm. Sebastian Winter\u00f8's cinematography is driven by the characters, lingering on their reactions longer than usual, letting the emotions sink in, and allowing the viewer to connect with the characters. This is impeccable work, aided by seamless editing (Jennifer Vecchiarello).Technically, it's a pretty well-produced film, but I do have an issue with the score by Emile Mosseri. I really enjoy most of the themes, but occasionally the volume is so loud that I had trouble listening to what the characters were saying. Since I had the option of going back a few seconds, I could hear some scenes again, so it didn't exactly hurt my viewing. However, it's still a technical issue that made me stop the movie, something I absolutely dislike, and I don't know how much it could have impacted me had I watched this film at a theater.In the end, Kajillionaire convinces me well enough to add Miranda July to my list of \"directors to follow closely\". Boasting a character-driven narrative and a unique filmmaking style, Evan Rachel Wood and Gina Rodriguez share impressive chemistry, elevating their characters' relationship, which is definitely the most captivating arc of the whole movie. Both Melanie and Old Dolio go through an extremely detailed yet visually subtle character development, which compelled me to root for their success in life. Gina steals the show with a career-best performance, but Evan's bizarre display is also remarkable, as well as Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger's excellent portrayals of the parents. Technically, Sebastian Winter\u00f8's camera work and Jennifer Vecchiarello's editing work perfectly together, but Emile Mosseri's beautiful score is occasionally dialed up to a volume that hurts some dialogues. The slow pacing employed doesn't quite work all the time, and the family's swindling business quickly loses interest besides defying logic a couple of times. Overall, I recommend it to everyone, so give it a watch if you can!Rating: B", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Crime,Drama"}, "index_36": {"review_id": "rw6070667", "reviewer": "Horst_In_Translation", "movie": "the roads not taken", "rating": "6", "review_summary": "Bardem kept it from getting too weak", "review_date": "6 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "\"The Roads Not Taken\" is a new 2020 movie that is actually not long at all, even under 1.5 hours and the writer and director is Sally Potter from England. And not only that. Apparently, this project is/was really close to her heart as she also worked as an editor here and contributed to the score/soundtrack. It is not the very first time for her in both departments, but still unusual. Potter has been making films since the late 1960s already, so for over 50 years now. Massively long career and she started with short films of course as they usually do. She is also 70 noww, almost 71, so almost relatively young still if we look at how long she has been in the industry. She also has not been the most prolific filmmaker and there are occasional breaks of sevveral years in her body of work. Anyway, experience pays off for her and so she gets Oscar winner Javier Bardem to play the lead role here. I will get to him later. His inclusion as well as the inclusion of young actress Elle Fanning made this an interesting project for me as I like both actors quite a bit and was always more Team Elle than Team Dakota, if you can even say that. Still good for the latter to have worked with Tarantino recently. Both their careers seem to be going well right now. And seriously, how can you not love Bardem, even if you maybe have not seen his Spanish-languiage films. This film here also has Spanish on some occasions, namely when he talks to Selma Hayek's character. Yep, another big name, but I must say her character and the story linked to said character were not among the film's highlights for me, even if I don't mind her as an actress, actually probably like her more than I did ten years ago or so. Another Oscar-nominated actress in here is Laura Linney. Fanning's character is occasionally on the phone with her, but she only has really one scene when she is seen, even if that is an okay scene and I was a bit surprised that I liked it because honestly Linney as an actress I have never been too fond of by any means and I feel she has a tendency to play the same character in every movie. Briefly back to Hayek, she plays the protagonist's childhood love if I understood correctly and I found it a bit difficult to understand if her character is just a spirit and maybe deceased or actually there, but this could also just be me. It made me wonder though with her connection to this celebration for the dead that Bardem's character goes to. It is also a but unclear which of the stwo story lines she is a part of. Maybe I would have to rewatch to understand 100% and also understand a little more. As for the title, I like it and I knew that there is a poem with a similar title. But not a book this is based on apparently, even if I think i read people saying something like they are not too happy with the adaptation, but I may just be erring here too. Maybe not with the execution. And I am not sure if the film is linked to this really old poem that I know from the title. Not too important anyway. What counts is the film as a stand-alone achievement. And there I would say it is not too bad. Yes, it may not be entirely smooth from beginning to end and especially the back and forth from the two stories is a bit uneven here and there, but like I said in the title of my review, I felt that Bardem carried it fairly nicely overall. Then again, like I also said, I am a bit biased when it comes to this actor for sure because I like him quite a bit.So this film is all about the \"what if\". How would his life gone forward had he left his wife and daughter when the latter as still very young and sacrificed his family for his craft. He is a writer. This is the second scenario, the one that has consideraly less screen time. There he stayed on a Greek island and actually wrote a book that is also closely connection with the question \"What if?\" And he seeks help from a duo of girls, one of them attracted to him, the other creeped out. That was fairly funny. He also seeks much more from them. At least from one of them and you know what I mean with that. But there is also tragedy because in the end he dies all alone on his boat. In the other reality, he does not die, but he is very sick and not there mentally 100% anymore. However, the one thing he is not is alone. He has the most loving and caring daughter who sacrifices pretty much everything, most of all her professional life to be there for her struggling ailing father. To help him when it's about visiting doctors, dentists etc. no matter what happens. And him swallowing the liquid that is there to clean his mouth after analysis is still among the more harmless things. When he pees all over his pants in this stressful situation at the dentis is among the harsher things and it was pretty sad to watch, also because it has a lot to do with dignity. But even there, his daughter (played by Fanning of course) knows no disgust and is there for him helping him with changing his trousers. And she keeps defending him when he is attacked by security personnel after taking somebody else's dog. Or she is there to speak up for him when people keep talking as if he is not in the room, although he understands them. So yeah, with the dog scene and this being linked with Hayek's character in her final scene, Hayek's character is probably also from the string of events with Bardem's character struggling mentally. Also fits that she is mentioned by Linney's character once and also that she comes to his bed early on, spirit/apparition or not. She is there. And how he calls his dog his son is a bit on the heartbreaking side, even if sadly the film never delivered as much on an emotional level for me as I would have hoped it could. But yeah, how he talks about his dog there, he seems to be pretty clean mentally and also speaks in a way where you can understand him well, whcih wasn't the case all before that and fittingly we hear Fanning's character complain and worry about the same issue. Not Bardem's fault though that it came a bit short emotionally for me. Not at all. Maybe it was just me anyway because honestly I think some of the other audience members in my showing had tears in their faces when the closing credits rolled in. I would have liked too. The one thing I struggled with honestly was near the end how Bardem's character in the key story line remembers or imagines his existence and death in the other story line. That did not fit in my opinion and also made no sense, especially because this life never existed. Only we know about it and are we supposed to believe that he in his struggling mental state can really make such a clear imagination and connection? Or maybe all we see in greece is really all he imagined and not how things really would have turned out. There is no clean explanation or solution there. Honestly before realizing these strings are parallels to each other i kinda felt that maybe these are just scenes from the past, from when he was still healthy, but it becomes clear pretty quickly that this is not the case. Still an interesting idea, even if the editing wwas not always top-notch. I am surprised there aren't really (m)any other films who take such an approach. Okay, what else is there to say. Unfortunately, I must also say that, as much as I liked Bardem, I was not always too fond of Fanning's portrayal. Once or twice, she went a bit over the top and also did not nail the emotional moments as much as I hoped she could. She still isn't bad, don't get me wrong, she is still among the most talented under 30 in my opinion. Oh well, she is barely over 20 and should have a bright career ahead of her hopefully. I will be cheering for her for sure. And she also has a few good moments, like when she cries from joy when he remembers her name at the end. There we also see that we never really found out her name before that, so of course it is a special moment for her character and he also feels her joy and is happy with her. Bardem acted this scene very nicely, just like everything else. And yeah, you cannot really blame Fanning for not (yet) being on par with an acting power house like Bardem. She still held her own pretty well next to him most of the time. So yes, I think it is a bit disappointing that this film has received almost no awards recognition, especially for Bardem, but the project's overall poor reception hurt his chances too. Still, it is not bad and I give it a thumbs-up and I say that you should not be kept away by the negative reviews and give this film a chance, especially if you are as much of a fan of the two lead actors here. Go see it! Also pretty wild to see all these European countries listed as producers here. That I did not expect. Okay, enough now. In short: Go watch this movie please. By the way, as for Bardem and his character, I sometimes had to think of how different paths would have resulted in major life changes here and coincidence and choices are also a huge thing for Bardem's Chigurh, so as different as the characters may be, there are also parallels. Maybe just me paying attention to that.

HER is being considered by many to be one of the greatest films of 2013 and one of the best love stories in recent years. I really wish I could feel the same because while I respect what Jones was going for, for the life of me I couldn't help but feel this really wasn't any different than the countless other bad love stories out there. I really, really tried to enjoy this film more than I did but in the end I just found it to be way too predictable, pretentious and boring. I will start off with the biggest problem and that's the Samantha character, which of course is the computer system. So let me get this straight. This system is supposed to be super intelligent yet in reality she's just as stupid as any other female character in a bad romance because who with any intelligence would fall for someone like Phoenix? I mean, he's really just a depressed man with some serious mental issues. Shouldn't this intelligent system have picked up on this? There wasn't a single second of this film that I actually connected with and there certainly wasn't any emotional connection to the Samantha character. The sex scenes? Just didn't work. The weird double date? Nah, didn't work. How about the \"other\" woman who is brought in for the sex? None of it worked for me. Again, I respect what Jones was trying to do but in the end I thought the screenplay was rather hollow. Phoenix is one of my favorite actors and I thought he offered up another great performance. I certainly believed him as this character and he certainly made me think that someone like this could fall for a computer. Amy Adams and Rooney Mara are both good but I must say I didn't think either one had a very good role. As for Johansson, I thought she did an extremely good job with the vocal work and managed to bring some real emotion to the voice but was it really any better than some of the stuff we see in animated movies? Obviously, if you can connect with the man-computer story then I'm sure you're going to enjoy this much more. The film has some wonderful cinematography and the score is great but there just wasn't anything here for me to really connect to.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_38": {"review_id": "rw5547854", "reviewer": "latifada", "movie": "the secret life of bees", "rating": "6", "review_summary": "Not as powerful as the book but still a good movie", "review_date": "13 March 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "A satisfying movie adaptation of a book, The Secret Life of Bees movie takes a heartwarming tale of race, spirituality, and womanhood and puts it onto the big screen. While it by no means carries the pure message of the book itself, the movie's stellar acting and excellent set makeup makes it a must watch for anybody who enjoyed the novel. In this movie, 14 year old Lily, a girl who lives with the guilt of accidentally killing her mother when she was young, escapes her abusive father with her black stand in mother, Rosaleen, to seek refuge in a small town in 1960s South Carolina. There, they find a unique trio of colored sisters who take them in. While staying with them, Lily learns new truths about her mother, acquires spirituality as a part of the sisters' eccentric religion, finds a true family, and learns a whole lot about beekeeping.\nWhile the Secret Life of Bees movie covers most of the main plot points of the book, it waters down some of the story's important conflicts. One such example is Lily's struggle to find out what really happened with her mother. Throughout most of the book, Lily wonders about her mother's link to the Boatwright sisters, and spends a good portion of time deliberating when she will ask August how they knew each other. However, by excluding scenes and narration that demonstrate Lily's complex emotions regarding this issue, the movie waters down an important conflict as well as Lily's character development. The movie also fails to display the emotional struggle Lily faces regarding whether her mother loves or not. While including some scenes which display Lily's emotional roller coaster, such as the scene where Lily hurls jars of honey screaming \"I hate you!\" and \"You never loved me!\", or the hint at the end when T-Ray tells Lily her mother came back for her, the movie does not fully develop the whole host of emotions Lily experiences as it excludes scenes and narration from the book that show Lily being confused and saddened by what she had discovered. With motherhood being a key theme of the novel, leaving out some of the struggles Lily faces in learning the truth about her biological mother weakens the strength of some of the story's key themes.\nThe movie also leaves underdeveloped some of the powerful relationships that grow between characters. For example, the movie fails to develop the bond that grows between Lily and Rosaleen by excluding key book scenes that are connecting moments for them. The scene where Lily and Rosaleen bathe in the river together after escaping Sylvan and the scene where Lily and Rosaleen cleanup the mess Lily makes after hurling honey jars around the guest house are particularly important moments for Lily and Rosaleen which don't make it into the film. This omission undermines the message of family and womanhood the book portrays. The relationship between Lily and the Daughters of Mary is also tapered to a great extent. The movie shows the whole host of the Daughters in just one scene, never showing the way Lily begins to bond with them and become one of them. Scenes from the book such as the Mary Day celebrations or the Daughters showing up to help when T-Ray finds Lily are omitted, and are important scenes that show Lily's relationship as one of the Daughters. The Daughters are a key symbol of spirituality, and their exclusion waters down the movie's representation of the theme.\nWhat The Secret Life of Bees movie lacks in storyline is partially made up for by its excellent acting that helps spring the book's spirit onto the big screen. All characters were well played, with exceptional acting on the part of August and Lily. Queen Latifah's August encompassed every bit of the loving and understanding motherlike figure August is for Lily and played a key role in giving the movie a feeling similar to that of the book. Dakota Fanning's Lily also captures the young, soul searching girl Lily is. While her part lacks enough narration to truly unveil the whole spectrum of Lily's emotions, Fanning successfully gives the viewer insight into Lily's feelings despite having a deficit of narration time. While all characters had great acting, some did not possess the original descriptions they were given in the book. T-Ray in the movie seemed nicer than the T-Ray in the book, as T-Ray in the movie seemed to yell less and be more civil toward Lily. The movie's Rosaleen also did not encompass the loud and obnoxious, but strong Rosaleen illustrated in the book. This difference made the movie feel more distinct from the book, and removed the opportunity from some comedic relief that the original Rosaleen could have delivered.\nAlso helping revive the original feeling of the book is the movie's accurate set makeup and props. Set in rural South Carolina in the 1960s, the movie features all sorts of relics from the era. Old cars, peach trees, Southern accents, and small towns all add a general feeling of being at the time and place of the setting. More specifically, the various places Lily travels to accurately mock up the settings of the book. For example, the Boatwright sisters' house is painted a tacky pink, just like the way it is described in the book. May's wall is also accurately designed, a low but long wall made up of stones put together by hand. The wall even includes the slips of paper May slides in between the gaps. Finally, the Black Mary sculpture is well resemblant of the way it was described in the book, an old, battered statue with a painted red heart and a lot of spiritual value. Accurate design of key props from the story accentuate the likeness of the movie to the book, and help develop the story's themes and symbols.\nOverall, The Secret Life of Bees movie is a great film for those who enjoyed the book, but does not completely encompass the book's pure message. A watered down storyline means the movie does not contain the entire thematic and emotional value of the book, but it does allow somebody who has read the book to put faces to names and better envision the story. In addition, The Secret Life of Bees' excellent acting and set makeup makes it an overall satisfying film for its genre and a good choice for the family or those who aren't necessarily looking for the book's pure emotional and thematic value. While it may not be the best film out there, The Secret Life of Bees is by no means not worth viewing.", "publish_date": "2008", "category": "Drama"}, "index_39": {"review_id": "rw3473885", "reviewer": "vivianzhu", "movie": "captain america: civil war", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Approaching Perfection", "review_date": "21 May 2016", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Is Captain America: Civil War perfect? Approaching perfection, but not perfection is how I will describe Captain America: Civil War upon second viewing. It is a film that is humorous, exhilarating, fun but still full of emotional weight. It is a film that has impeccable action sequences and beautiful CGI, a film that outruns The Avengers: Age of Ultron by far and is just as awesome as the second installment of the Captain America trilogy - The Winter Soldier. Hey, but what about the plot conveniences? True, there are indeed plot conveniences and traces of the film makers 'making things happen', instead of dragging out plot points logically. This was indeed a flaw, because truly good movies are often based on real-life 'sense'. However, the difference between a movie and real life is that, in a movie, the unreasonable components of the plot can be tucked away in a well paced, well cut film. This is exactly what happened in Captain America, Civil War. The Russo brothers knew how to cut the film so that tension is maintained throughout and the story never breaks. All the pieces of the plot are strung together and played out step by step, joining together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a big picture. By making the big picture well constructed and well paced, the existence of plot conveniences didn't bring the whole film down. Though more logical links and less plot convenience will certainly make this a better movie. You've got to admit the villain is bad though, right? Certainly, just like the majority of other MCU villains, Zemo was a mediocre villain at best, and a huge plot convenience at worst. His plans to turn the heroes against each other was a clever one, but his methods of succeeding in such a convoluted plan was never explained. Maybe the film did not need the villain, and the Civil War could happen because of Iron Man and Captain America's difference in opinions. That worked int he comics, that should also work here. However, I do think having the villain in the movie added to certain aspects of the 'Civil War', putting the heavy fact of Tony's parents' death into the last fight, giving it emotional weight and higher stakes. And the 'no stakes' Civil War? Many people believe that Disney owned projects are trying too hard to appeal to the family and put no real stakes into their movies in case it upsets the eight year old boys who is a die-hard Captain America fan. People accuse Marvel for not having enough 'guts' to kill off, or even disable characters permanently. However, I would argue that Marvel films so far has struck a good balance between 'family friendly' and 'high stakes'. Comic book fans will know that no hero stays dead, whole runs are often dedicated to superheroes coming back to life. Nobody ever says there are no stakes in all comic books every, right? Why? Because comic books don't need reversible deaths to have stakes, the stakes lies in the emotional connection between friends, lovers and family. As 'Disney' movies need to be family friendly and superheroes shouldn't die, Marvel films worked on making the emotional stakes high. In Civil War, the emotional stakes are very high as the ideological differences build to a peak, only to encounter a personal matter that completely derails Tony Stark. The pain constant in Tony's eyes was portrayed perfectly by Robert Downey Jr., other characters such as Black Panther were given great personal arcs too. These character moments are what gives Marvel movie emotional weight, as well as fun. For a person who is invested in the MCU, this movie's stakes is incredibly high due to my value in the friendship between the Avengers. Isn't it just poor film making, like every other Superhero film? A defiant no. Superhero movies are not Godfather or Citizen Kane, they won't push all the frontiers of great film making or open new doors to creative processes. However, this does not prevent them from being a good movie. What does a good movie need? Interesting plot, strong characters, good visuals. By these elements I don't mean they have to be outstanding and noticeable. It means that the plot is interesting enough to hold the audience's attention throughout the movie, the characters are strong enough to warrant an emotional connection, and the visuals are great enough to allow audiences to suspend disbelief. Having these elements do not guarantee an Oscar, but having them means that the movie will be an enjoyable one. Civil War was an enjoyable movie with all three elements above, with added emotional finesse that can be fully understood by those who have watched previous films. It was also a humorous film, with most jokes landing perfectly and inspiring laughs all over the place. Furthermore, it was a film that was really satisfying to watch, as it is full of awesome, kick-ass action scenes that didn't feel unnecessary. Yes, the airport scene may lack some 'reality', but no one can deny it was 18 minutes of none stop fun and eye candy. Yes, the score may be forgettable, but it served its purpose as a atmosphere building block that made moments better. All in all, Civil War is a film that holds up to a second viewing in the cinemas. It has a very engaging story to tell with some very engaging characters and talented actors. It managed to bring Black Panther and Spiderman into the MCU perfectly, with two great actors who fit the role perfectly. And though it is an imperfect movie, it is still one that's worth your time.", "publish_date": "2016", "category": "Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi"}, "index_40": {"review_id": "rw6114601", "reviewer": "andrewroy-04316", "movie": "aliens", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Aliens is close behind its predecessor in atmosphere, and surpasses it in theme and emotion", "review_date": "22 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Aliens is a very worthy sequel to a sci-fi icon. Alien was a pure, uncompromising sci-fi thriller with no scene or moment wasted. To that end, it's also more of an experience being in that setting and feeling the fear and uncertainty the characters do more so than a film with a lot for the audience to think about. Alien achieves its aim admirably, but for my tastes Aliens manages to even improve upon it. We don't get quite the same level of nervousness and claustrophobia here, and some of the action scenes feel a bit more shoot em up than I'd like, but Aliens more than makes up for it. I do think Aliens is comparable to Alien in how realistic the space mission is, in the excellent alien design, and in the general plot arc and rising tension throughout. The thrills are definitely still present - especially when Newt and Ripley are together and you can see their fear for each other, I was on the edge of my seat. On top of that, Aliens has plenty on its mind. Sigourney Weaver is absolutely fantastic here - the script is great and we feel a deep connection to her journey. Thematically, greed is explicitly explored, and I liked the way human arrogance was considered early in the film, but the omnipresent themes are motherhood and survival. Ripley clearly feels a deep connection to Newt and feels responsible for protecting her. At the same time, the aliens are hyperefficient in doing the only thing they care about: surviving, along with their children. Female roles and trusting women in general is crucial here, as the commanders are quick to write off Ripley as crazy and delusional at the start of the film. It also takes far too long for the crew to start respecting Ripley as a key member. Interestingly, they all respect Vasquez, but that's because the way she proves herself is the same masculine way men prove themselves: through physical prowess and bravado. Ripley has a different type of strength, but it is obvious by the end of the film that she is the most resourceful and hardiest of them all.On the subject of arrogance, the big difference in premise here is that Ripley already knows what they're like and is warning everyone - the Marines are coming in with fully stocked firepower, unlike the team in Alien. Despite their expectation, everyone in the crew expects it to be a walk in the park; they can't fathom the fact that they could fail or meet a challenge greater than them, and when they do, many of them crumble. Alien is a more pure experience, but Aliens left me with much more to think about when the credits rolled.The other thing Aliens does very well is establish emotional connection. I loved Newt as a character here, and it's a very strong child performance by Henn. As I mentioned, Weaver is exceptional in the lead. The cast of characters may seem to have some stereotypes in there, but I can also appreciate the way Cameron turns away from some tropes, such as having the AI be helpful here, and the turn of Burke is very well done. It's really the connection between Newt and Ripley that makes us root so hard for them to survive, along with a bit of appreciation for Hicks as a brave and open minded leader. I can see why many would like Alien more, and obviously everything that Cameron does well here is on the back of the massive success that Scott created, but Aliens was a really fun, thrilling watch for me.", "publish_date": "1986", "category": "Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi"}, "index_41": {"review_id": "rw2949298", "reviewer": "Amari-Sali", "movie": "august: osage county", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "If a soap opera was given a movie after being canceled, it would be something like August: Osage County.", "review_date": "26 January 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Just the name of the cast is what should easily draw you to the film.

The others in the film get to occasionally jump in and go at it with these two, while sometimes getting some dialog in about what is happening in their own lives.The main issues include Barbara and Bill's (played by Ewan McGregor) marital issues; Karen's (played by Juliette Lewis) relationship issues, of which currently Steve (played by Dermot Mulroney) is the next one likely to be a screw-up; Mattie Fae's (played by Margo Matindale) issues when it comes to her son Little Charles (played by Benedict Cumberbatch), her marriage to Charles Sr. (played by Chris Cooper), as well her upbringing with sister Violet; and lastly there is Ivy's (played by Julianne Nicholson) issues, of which a man is involved.PraiseAs you can expect, the praise for the film definitely goes to Meryl Streep, though admittedly I feel the main reason she is deserving of praise is because when you compare Violet to Streep's other roles, Violet stands out due to her not being the type of character which calls for tight control of your emotions and actions. Violet is loose and vulgar, and Streep being in a character which cares nothing about poise is refreshing. Same goes for Julia Roberts who curses, and can be as nasty, if not nastier, than Streep sometimes is with her character.And really, though the overall story seemed a bit condensed, rushed, and so much like a soap opera summed up into 2 hours, it really does keep you attentive. Between the arguments between Barbara and everyone; mixed in with a decent amount of family drama, including a family secret, you won't end up bored.CriticismBut, at the same time I think I should note that both Streep and Robert's performances are a double-edged sword. For while it is interesting to watch both of these actresses, who usually don't pick these type of women to portray, their performances feel more like cathartic releases more than the type of performances meant to make you get lost in their characters or even make you feel something. And the reason I say this is because it seems both Barbara and Violet pretty much argue with each other, or the cast, until exhaustion, and then someone gets to interject and talk about their character's life, and then it is back to being about Barbara or Violet. Which, you can understand to a point since Roberts and Streep are the two money making names of the film, but after a certain point I felt like they are being focused on too much and that no one else is being allowed to try to connect to the audience at all. In fact, I'd say the film stripped the emotional complexities of these characters, who have gone through abuse, being cheated on and etc., and all that is left to see is 2 hours of the type of mindless drama which seems written no better than your general daytime soap opera, but it benefits from having a more seasoned cast.Overall: TV ViewingStreep remains good but, despite this character change, it doesn't shake you up and make you think she is topping herself at all. She is simply working, and due to her work being better than most, what is average for her seems superb in comparison to her fellow actresses. As for the rest of the cast, while it is nice to see Roberts play a more vulgar character, she is forgetful in the long run and everyone else pretty much plays second fiddle to the lives of these two actresses' characters. Thus making the film only worth TV viewing. For while the drama is interesting, it doesn't create any emotional connection and really is just soap opera drama put into a 2 hour movie of which sometimes it feels like the attempt to give everyone a back-story leads to no one being particularly interesting or well done.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Comedy,Drama"}, "index_42": {"review_id": "rw2942925", "reviewer": "shawneofthedead", "movie": "her", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "A lovely, sensitive, grown-up romance that both benefits and suffers from its sci-fi bent.", "review_date": "16 January 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Here's the thing: strictly speaking, we've all seen Her before, in some romantic comedy or other. Lonely, emotionally unavailable guy must learn how to truly open his heart as his marriage dissolves around him. He meets a girl he would never think to date in a million years - but, somehow, she changes him and his views on the world, love and romance. It's a tale as old as time.The twist in Spike Jonze's love story for a new millennium? The girl in question has neither body nor face; she's an artificially intelligent operating system - think Siri v200.0 - who can grow, learn, evolve and, apparently, love. This twist is what sets Her apart - but also what creates an almost clinical detachment in the film that's tricky to process within the context of its narrative.In a subtly distant future, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a loner subsisting on the periphery of human connection. He's undergoing a painful divorce from Catherine (Rooney Mara), his college sweetheart, and spends his days creating handwritten letters for other people. The last thing he expects to do is form a real emotional connection with his brand new operating system, who introduces herself as Samantha (voice of Scarlett Johansson). As she cleans up his e-mail inbox and sets up appointments for him, the two chat, banter and stumble blissfully into a relationship: one that eventually grows complicated with the encroaching weight of societal convention, expectations and metaphysics.Bravely, Her is ultimately not about whether a human being and an operating system can fall in love. Within Jonze's sweetly fractured universe, the answer is obviously that they can. Once the first flush of infatuation fades away, Theodore and Samantha both fret about their unlikely and unconventional relationship. She even tries, in a disastrously awkward moment, to engage the services of Isabella, a willing sexual surrogate (Portia Doubleday), to better conform to the traditional expectations of romance that inevitably involve physical consummation. But these concerns arise precisely because their connection is so deep and so true, and it's played very respectfully as such.In fact, it's played in so intensely straightforward a fashion that it can sometimes feel a little too forced. Several key emotional moments in the film tread a very, very fine line between poignant drama and unintended hilarity: when Theodore and Samantha first forge a sexual connection, for instance, or when Theodore struggles mightily with Samantha's sexual advances in the form of Isabella. At these points, Jonze's solution is to play it all completely straight. In effect, when showing us is not quite enough, he tells us that Theodore and Samantha's love exists and cannot be denied. This can make for a disconcerting experience as a viewer: in order for the film's central conceit to work, its most important relationship is played almost desperately as more than it amounts to on screen.It's easy, too, to get nervous in the first third of the film about the premise for Theodore's relationship with Samantha: she's literally tailor-made for him and comes to life only when he plugs his ear-piece in. As Theodore wanders happily through his budding romance with this perfect girlfriend who's entirely at his beck and call, we start to get a deeper idea of just what went wrong in Theodore's marriage: somewhere along the way, Catherine stopped being the person he wanted her to be.Her, as it turns out, is most effective in its exploration of the notions of self and personal growth in the context of love. The film cleverly uses its science-fiction - soon-to-be science-fact, for all we know - to convey the simplest of messages in the starkest of terms: loving someone is about accepting them for who they are, however messy, complicated and troublesome it might be. It's about watching them grow, and possibly growing away from you, but loving them anyway. In this respect, Samantha's evolution, from chipper daily planner to her own person with her own dreams and personality, is subtly and beautifully developed throughout.Phoenix, as always, is wonderful. For very good reason, he's become one of the most interesting and reliably great actors of his generation: Theodore Twombly, of the almost determinedly fairy-tale name, is sweet, sensitive, and broken - a world away from the maniacally violent Freddie Quell in The Master. He strikes up remarkable chemistry with Mara, suggesting a wealth of history and heartbreak in a relationship that gets barely ten minutes of screen-time. There are a couple of great supporting turns as well from the eternally lovely Amy Adams (as Theodore's good friend Amy) and Chris Pratt (as Theodore's cheerfully open-minded colleague).But the real star of the show is Johansson, who never once turns up on screen but nonetheless manages to forge an indelibly real character. In the husky, sweet, kittenish and everything-in-between cadences of Johansson's voice, Samantha blooms and blossoms. At the last minute, Johansson replaced Samantha Morton - who had already completed all her voice-work - in the role. It would certainly be interesting to see just how different the film would be with Morton in the part, but it's also impossible to imagine Her without Johansson.On the surface, Her is a meditation on the technological advancements of the past decade and how they have led to an ever-growing proportion of the world's population living their lives on - and as defined by - the Internet. We can be friends with, effectively, disembodied voices: people from the other side of this globe that we might never meet in person. Jonze's film has gained its fair share of attention for being enormously topical and zeitgeist-y. But it's actually in Her's intelligent, sensitive treatment of the perils and lessons of love - part of the human condition since time immemorial - that it really resonates.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_43": {"review_id": "rw6348116", "reviewer": "jeremyfrydman", "movie": "le samoura\u00ef", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "The Psyche Of A Sociopath", "review_date": "8 December 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 masterpiece Le Samoura\u00ef is a groundbreaking and brilliant film about the psychology and motto of a french assassin named Jef Costello and his struggle living in France, not understanding how to adapt to modern civilization. Melville's film is a prime example of the brilliance of the cinema produced within the French new wave and how to portray the psyche of a sociopath.Instead of exploring a more modern traditional assassin commonly explored in more modern cinema, Melville decides to examine a man born out of his time and into a world he doesn't fully understand. The film's protagonist Jef Costello played brilliantly by Alain Delon lives by the ancient forgotten code of the samurai. Costello is a stone-cold killer, he shows no remorse for his victims, no regret for his crimes and shows not an ounce of emotion throughout the film's runtime. Usually, a character like this would make for a fairly uninteresting protagonist, more classically trained filmmakers usually give characters an emotional arc, Melville still decides to do this but twists it. Through a layered performance, Delon portrays a man unable to connect with modern culture and incapable of connecting to the people around him, so much so Costello's only friend is a caged bird forced to be with him throughout the film's runtime.The first introduction we have of Costello is him laying on his bed smoking a cigarette observing his birds actions and listening to the sounds of France. The scene is shot in complete darkness, with Costello's body barley visible to the blind eye, the only thing somewhat visible is the smoke coming from his cigarette. This is a fascinating and unique way to introduce a character. The scene is remarkably empty of colour and visually uninspired and bland, more modern filmmakers usually give their protagonists grand, bright and flamboyant introductions, but Melville decides to introduce his character in the dark. What better way of introducing a man out of his time and without emotion than by showing him alone, confined in his home, in complete darkness, in his home, a room he uses to confine himself inside, imprisoning his thoughts and desires with him in complete darkness, in the one place he feels comfortable enough to smoke in peace.The way Melville decides to helm the film is what is most commendable about the picture. His direction and clear vision are conveyed throughout the runtime of the film. What Melville does understand is how to connect an audience member to a protagonist who in most cases they could never understand. Melville takes time to let the viewer watch Costello's private time alone in his home, his interactions with the general public and people, the way he completes daily tasks and the way he decides to murder people. It's a fascinating and unique portrayal of a man that general audiences wouldn't truly understand. Melville understands that while Costello's actions are wrong he isn't entirely evil.Costello's remaining humanity is explored with his relationship with Jane Lagrange played by Nathalie Delon, the former wife of the film's lead star. Melville uses Janes complex relationship with Jef as a way of exploring Costello's fleeting care for humanity. Jane is a prostitute, the lowest low in France. A woman the general public would view as scum, a woman who would be tossed over, used and forgotten. Like Jef, Jane has trouble connecting to the inhabitants of France and while Jef and Jane's relationship is mostly sexual, they share a bond in the fact that they both have a lack of understanding of how the world works.While made 53 years ago, Le Samoura\u00ef is a potent, powerful and meaningful piece of cinema created due to the vision of director Jean-Pierre Melville.

Like many mistresses of that day, Nelly (played by Felicity Jones) must not be out in public, hence the title of the movie. The plot idea is interesting but the movie itself is slow and boring. Over all I give this movie a 70% out of a 100%.The level of acting in this movie is about 80% out of 100%. Joanna Scanlan, who plays Mrs. Dickens, did a wonderful job in this movie. Her character was very compelling and she had the right level of emotions at the proper time for her character to really develop. Ralph Fiennes, playing Charles Dickens, also acted very well. His character was inviting and the audience is able to see why a young girl like Nelly would fall for an older man like Dickens. Felicity Jones, playing Nelly didn't leave me with much of an impression, good or bad. I feel like some of the scenes could have used a bit more on the emotional level but that could be the fault of the character development.The character and relation development in this movie was bad. I would rate it at 65% out of 100%. They never really showed the development of a relationship between Nelly and Charles Dickens. They showed hints of it for a long time and when they finally get together they don't show the fun in their relationship. Nelly has left her good name behind to be with this man and the movie doesn't show if it is really worth it. They show one scene of them enjoying time together and it is of Nelly watching him write as they sit under a tree. The relationship between Nelly and her other family members aren't really clear. I can understand not focusing very much on that aspect but I fell like that could have taken up more of the storyline. I fell like that would have helped the audience connect to her more because they would know about where she is coming from. Nelly's state of invisibility wasn't emphasized enough during the movie. It showed her living in a house alone but it didn't show how she suffered by being the other woman. The loneliness and isolation from society wasn't clearly shown. That should have been the driving point of this movie. The one relationship that I felt developed really well was the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Dickens. From the beginning of the movie it shows that they aren't really connected any more. When he introduces his family, she is the last to be introduced and his tone suggest that he almost forgot that she was there. She is often shown wearing a placid face while watching him be the center of attention and ignoring her. In one scene, as Dickens walks in on her naked she rushes to cover herself. I feel like this really shows that she isn't really connected with him anymore. They have at least ten children together and yet she is uncomfortable being naked in front of her husband. The one scene in the movie that was really powerful for me was when he had boards put up in the doorway between their rooms. The scene shows her to be literally cut off from her husband as he moves on with another woman. The thing that really brought down the level of enjoyment for me was the speed of the movie. They took such a long time with the introduction stage of the movie that they didn't have enough time to really develop the characters and some of the major plot points. Over all I feel like there are better movies to be seen in this genre.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Biography,Drama,History"}, "index_45": {"review_id": "rw2939854", "reviewer": "estebangonzalez10", "movie": "short term 12", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "Forget about the Squid and The Whale, the Octopus raps!", "review_date": "11 January 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "\"You need to get ready because it's so unbelievable it's going to seem fake, but I promise you it's not, Grace will vouch for me...It's a storytellers wet dream.\"Every once in a while a surprising film like Short Term 12 comes around reminding me why I love cinema so much. This is only my second five star review from 2013 and this small indie absolutely hit all the right notes with me taking me through a wide range of emotions thanks to its perfect balanced mix of comedy and touching drama. I was drawn to these characters from the very opening scene and was completely engaged with the story. Having visited a foster care facility a couple times last year and spent some time with kids going through similar situations, this film really hit home and helped me empathize more with them. In a way I kind of felt like Nate, the new counselor in this film who didn't connect right away with the kids and there was not much he could do to help considering he had no idea where they were coming from. On the other hand, the two other counselors, Grace and Mason, really connected with the children because they came from similar backgrounds and understood how they were feeling. Short Term 12 writer and director, Destin Cretton, uses this film as a vehicle to let the viewer have a better understanding of the social situation these kids go through. I don't know if this would've worked so well if it weren't for the incredibly touching performances from the cast. Brie Larson is so great in this film, she hit all the right notes, and in some way she reminded me of Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone. She has that same potential and her career will definitely take off after this. She deserves an Oscar nomination because she's that good. Her co-lead, John Gallagher Jr. also delivers a terrific performance and if we haven't heard much about him it's because Larson steals most of the thunder here. Even the kids in this film were terrific and that's why I'm giving this film the highest possible grade because it does everything right.Grace (Brie Larson) is one of the young counselors at Short Term 12, a foster care facility for at risk teenagers. Along with Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), with whom she's in a relationship, they look after these kids who have come from a troubled past. The film opens with Mason welcoming a new counselor named Nate (Rami Malek), and he shares a story with him about his first day which didn't go too great. Then they introduce some of the kids to him: there's Marcus (Keith Stanfield) who's about to turn 18 and therefor will be leaving the facility soon, Sammy (Alex Calloway) who's going through a deep psychological trauma, and Luis (Kevin Hernandez) who's easygoing but enjoys bullying Marcus. A few days later a new teenage girl named Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the foster care center who seems to be deeply scarred. Grace begins to connect with her and realizes they have come from a similar past. Grace and Mason are both excellent counselors, mostly because they have come from a troubled past themselves, and despite helping these kids they also have to deal with their own scars in life if they want their relationship to work. I loved the way that Cretton decided to open the film with Mason telling Nate a story, and then deciding to end it with another one. The structure of this film was just perfectly executed and I loved the balance it maintained. There were several different plots going on as each kid was going through different problems. The final scene in this film literally gave me goose bumps all over my body. Many people had an issue with it ending with such a positive note, but I thought it was perfect. Larson is a major reason why this film worked so well, her character Grace is just that: a graceful person who is doing her best to help these kids while at the same time trying to deal with her own demons. Dever and Stanfield also deliver powerful secondary performances and each one of them shares a memorable scene with one of their counselors as they try to express their feelings through different ways: Marcus does so by rapping and Jayden by reading a story. These two scenes are extremely powerful and emotional and they stand out in the film without feeling forceful or manipulative at all. This film just has so much heart and it's no surprise it has such a high rating (99% on Rottentomatoes) because it really is a vivid portrait that draws us in to these characters troubled lives in the pursuit and need of healing. Brie Larson's Grace has just become my favorite heroine of the year. That octopus story will stick with me forever, there was a lot of powerful stuff in this film.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama"}, "index_46": {"review_id": "rw5941273", "reviewer": "sycik18", "movie": "dil bechara", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "A decent remake of Fault in our Stars", "review_date": "26 July 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "I would like to start of with saying. Though people will agree with high ratings since the demise of Sushant Singh Rajput, still feel need the of giving a honest review of the movie. Like everyone else who has watched Late SSR's movies, i too felt over whelmed when the movie started. To the extend that i had tears fall down unknowingly.Keep all that aside. The movie in comparison to the original did not really have that same feeling ( and yes it would be compared to original). The main problem i felt as soon as the movie started was the main lead actress's (Sanjana Sanghi) voice and dialogue delivery. We do not relate and feel her pain as a Cancer patient, her struggle carrying the cylinder around, her facial expressions, the way she spoke. Did not really make you feel connected, sad or emotional. I feel someone like Alia Bhatt could pull it off or someone else who could portray the characters vulnerability better.Late SSR, played his role decently, as the lover boy fighting his own battles, head-over-heels with Kizzy. You like and appreciate his character- the charm, smile and need to do anything. But i did feel some repeated facial expressions made felt unnecessary and not relating to the dialogue said. The connection of our main to leads did not seem as strong as the original or even independently. The only best part i felt was when Manny fell ill. SSR played that really well and the fact that he has a prosthetic leg.From all characters i felt Saswata Chattergee's character was played most sincerely. You can feel he is a caring, loving and understanding father who is hurting inside. On the contrary, the mother's role was weird. At one point she had a problem with Kizzy's virginity and on the other end was okay when she lost it.The music was good. A.R.Rahman as always. My favourites would be the title track, Main tumhara and Taare Ginn.In total, it was a decent film. But not late SSR's best performance. The movie lacked the feels to make the audience connect with the characters. And felt rushed towards the later half.

The devil all the time for me was just nasty and horrible to watch and there were not many good elements for me sadly, let's talk about this more in detail.Let's be nice and start with a few positives, I liked the narration, character background and the performances were particularly good. The use of narration was done well to make you understand how the characters were feeling as well as adding some background and development to them as well. I also thought the movie spent a decent amount of time on most of the characters backgrounds. The movie spent a lot of time developing characters pasts to make you understand where they were at the present time which was well done and a good amount of time was spent on it making it not seem rushed. The cast and performances here was also very good, I have to say the cast was very impressive, and despite me not liking any of the characters ( which we will get into later ) all the cast did a good job with what they were given, with intense and unsettling performances that I haven't seen from some of the actors involved here before.However, my first few negatives would be the unlikeable main character, slow pacing, and disconnect from the plot and characters. The movies main character was incredibly unlikeable, the director somehow thought that him killing a load of bad people would make him likeable or someone to connect with but no it achieved the complete opposite. Making him just as bad as the other characters despite Tom Hollands commendable performance. The movie was also very slow paced. The movie in general was just very dull and slow paced, and I often found myself losing interest, due to the lack of anything really going on in parts, the interesting things that happened in the movie weren't consistent enough at all. Next I had no emotional connection to the movie or any connection to the plot and characters. The movie had so many deaths that it was hard to keep up, and due to how sudden they were with practically no depth, development, or real reasoning I didn't care about any of them. I just found the character work and the plot terrible and not something that I could connect with at all, and the movie did nothing to make anything positive or after a while interesting to watch.My next few negatives would be the poor roles for women, how over the top the movie was and the overly dark tone that didn't work. The roles for all the women in the movie was terrible, I get it was set in the past but so many movies like this still give substantial roles for women, they were all killed off, had no development or depth for them and were practically just there to please and look after the men, the movie was also incredibly over the top, no offense to some of the actors involved here but a lot of the accents were terrible, I was often laughing out loud when I wasn't supposed to and they had so many dark moments that it just got too much and more and more ridiculous that they just lost their impact completely. The movie also had a way too dark tone that did nothing. The movie was incredibly dark and disturbing and if done right can be great within a movie. But in this case they served no purpose to the overall plot whatsoever. The movie was just going for shock factor but failing to link it to the actual movie, making it basically just a load of messed up people killing each other, it was just really poor.My final few slight positives would be the set pieces, the equal amount of time and connections between characters as well as some chemistry between actors. The movie did a good job at making the set locations look like the desired time period shown throughout, and in general there was some interesting and visually pleasing filming locations. I also thought the movie did a good job at splitting it's time equally with all the characters, giving everyone an opportunity to have their stories told, and also I liked how a lot of the characters were linked together in some way despite it not always being enough to justify them being connected I appreciated the effort, and some of the actors had believable chemistry that worked well on screen especially from Tom Holland and Eliza Scanlen.However, my final few negatives would be lack of depth to the plot, as well as it's lack of cohesiveness. And finally, the dull ending. The movie had no depth whatsoever apart from surface level karma and people fighting demons. The movie didn't even attempt to go deep into the characters, and the plot just lacked any form of cohesiveness, it felt like separate stories that were lazily linked together just for the sake of it. The ending was also extremely dull and left me feeling nothing for the movie, they didn't have any satisfying character arcs hardly any of the characters were alive and it was just an unpleasant hard to watch final act that never went anywhere beyond a few mediocre kills.Overall, despite boasting an impressive cast with great performances. The devil all the time is a bland, lifeless, depressing, over the top and overly dark film. That has nothing likeable or compelling going for it and was honestly hard to watch until the end due to the lack of effort put in.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Crime,Drama,Thriller"}, "index_48": {"review_id": "rw6074093", "reviewer": "rnixon-15663", "movie": "come as you are", "rating": "6", "review_summary": "Come as you are", "review_date": "7 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Come as you are\n2020\n15\nDirector: Richard Wong\nStarring: Grant Rosenmeyer, Hayden Szeto, Ravi Patel, Gabourey Sidibe, Janeane Garofalo, C S Lee, Jennifer Jelsema etcOverall rating 66/100\nCome as you are is about three disabled adults who are desperate to lose their virginity, but haven't had the opportunities to due to their limitations, so they all team together to travel to a brothel that specialises in people like them, where they will learn the true meaning of friendship. I wanted to like Come as you are a whole lot more than what I did, It had all the right ingredients just fell apart with the plot and lack of emotional connection to the movie, let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the movie was very funny. Had unique characters that aren't usually used in comedies, was inclusive and normalised disability. I loved that this movie had unique characters that aren't usually explored within a comedy with fear of offending people, it was really refreshing to have the whole main cast having some form of disability, this is because they could have jokes between them rarely used In other comedies out of fear of offending people but in this case it was very different, so the characters were refreshing and well explored throughout the movie, the movie was also very inclusive and normalised disability, this movie was not afraid to have characters with all sorts of disabilities, body shapes and capabilities, which was lovely to see, they didn't make it a big deal either which is the message they should be spreading with normalising disability, and seeing it through the characters perspectives in the film helped me gain a deeper understanding of what people with disabilities have to go through. The movie was also hilarious, I belly laughed on multiple occasions, the movies sarcastic humour and characters taking the mick out of themselves was a type of humour that I haven't seen a lot before so it was nice to see, with many awkward situations involving their disabilities involved with the characters were very funny as well.My next few positives would be the likeable characters, character depth to the main character and good character background. Every single one of the characters had very likeable qualities to them, all three main characters had different and likeable personalities, with a great mixture of sensitive, funny and charming that all blended really well, I also appreciated the amount of depth they added to the main character, to see how much he struggled and wanted his independence but knowing his restrictions, was heart-breaking to watch and it really made you understand what his character was going through and the reasoning for his actions throughout the movie. I also liked the character background they put in for all the characters. The movie spent a good amount of time making you understand each of the characters and the dynamic with their families, all three having different experiences with their disabilities and different limitations was explored well.However, my first few negatives would be the rushed beginning with a lack of character background and how predictable it was. They didn't allow any room for any form of background to the characters at the beginning and didn't give the movie enough room to breathe and just went straight into the main plot point which I personally didn't like. I also thought the movie was fairly predictable in parts, there was parts were some characters couldn't take part in the main plot point due to being in relationships, so it was obvious what it was going to happen and made parts feel rushed and it lacked deep enough thought.My final few positives would be the charming tone, script, development of plot and characters and satisfying ending. The movie had a very charming tone, in terms of the growing connection between all the characters, and their relationships developing was just heart-warming to watch. The script was also excellent, and for me one of the best parts of the movies, the movie had so much clever and thoughtful dialogue that really made you understand the characters and a deeper understanding of people with disabilities. I also really liked the development of plot and characters, I really loved what the movie changed into, instead of a movie about three people going to a brothel and having sex, the plot developed and changed into a story about friendship and appreciating life which I loved, and I loved how all the characters had some form of change as the movie progressed and as everyone grew closer. The ending was also very satisfying, I loved that despite still going to the brothel the aftermath of this was handled very well and made the characters much more likeable and made things a lot more satisfying, they made the right decisions with the relationships with the characters and it was handled better than what I was expecting.My final few negatives would be the main plot getting tired, the lack of depth to the characters or themes, and the questionable character decisions. The movie made some odd questionable decisions with the main character. Some things he said during the movie to some of the characters made him fairly unlikeable in places and the movie didn't try hard enough to make him more likeable. I also thought the main plot point of the characters going to a brothel got really tired for me and I wish they had gone for something different. With the amount of drama it caused for the characters they should have been going somewhere more important than a brothel. My final negative would be the lack of depth to the characters and themes, this was my biggest issue with the film, I was never emotionally connected to it whatsoever. Whenever there was something bad or a deep theme trying to be portrayed to the audience, they touched on the surface off It and never went deeper, making my connection to the characters and the film itself very limited.Overall, despite a fantastic script, and characters that are so often forgotten about in film get the spotlight they deserve, I was never connected to the movie, due to it's unprofessional way of handling deep themes and often playing it safe.", "publish_date": "2019", "category": "Comedy,Drama"}, "index_49": {"review_id": "rw5548447", "reviewer": "cardoang", "movie": "the secret life of bees", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "Secret Life of Bees Review", "review_date": "13 March 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "In Gina Prince-Bythewood's screenplay version of the book, The Secret life of Bees, star actors like Jennifer Hudson as Rosaleen, Queen Latifa as August, and Alicia Keys as June bring strong, emotion evoking elements to tell the story of Lily and her journey. Produced in 2008, the movie The Secret Life of Bees brought some of the important key themes from Sue Monk Kidd's book like racial equality, the importance of motherhood, and forgiveness. Set in 1964, at the time of the Civil Rights Act, a girl named Lily embarks on a journey with her African American caretaker named Rosaleen to find out the mystery of her mother's death, making deep and love filled connections along the way. The actors bring to life the book and lead you on a heartfelt journey that takes you through the emotions of heartbreak, joy, sadness, and empathy.\nThe cast did an amazing job with interpreting the characters. They became the character and understood how the characters would react towards different scenarios. With the exception of T-Ray, Lily's father, the character description perfectly matched the actor who was playing them. In the book, T-Ray seemed more hardened, scarier, and bigger. In the movie, he was depicted as more emotional, sweeter, and scrawnier. This throws off the viewer because most would speculate why Lily might have had so much hatred directed towards T-Ray if he is not shown as fierce and heartless as he is in the book. Besides T-Ray, I believe the cast was perfect for the characters, and I applaud them for how well they portrayed the role of their character and how they brought to life what it was like to live in 1964.\nThe scenery made it believable that this movie took place in 1964. The buildings and society around them expressed older elements, like the Sunday attire to church, that consisted of big showy hats and conservative dresses. I also feel that there are some scenes that are added that brought more real and true elements to the story. For example, when Lily is going to touch the Black Mary, flashbacks are incorporated to show that Lily was thinking about her mother. On the contrary, the book gave more insight on Lily's thoughts than the movie did. Without this, less of Lily's emotions were shown and it caused the viewer to not understand Lily's viewpoint as much. Furthermore, The music was too happy and light for the weight and heaviness of the movie. The movie could have resided with the viewer more if the music had more somber elements.\nThere were some scenes that significantly changed the movie plot in comparison to the book. This included some heavy scenes that built connections within the characters. This was the most let down of this movie. Without previous knowledge of the book, the viewer cannot understand the depth of some of these characters' connections. The other biggest let down of the movie is that it moved too quick. Somethings, like a main character's death, were pushed away quickly and did not give the viewer enough time to grieve or process. This caused me to dislike the movie more because the viewers will never understand the gravity of the scenes taken out of the movie. Finally, the movie completely removed the religious aspect. The religious aspect was not only one of the biggest themes throughout the book but it also helped with character development and growth within the characters.\nOverall, the movie was a good movie that showed the issues of racial discrimination and the importance of motherhood. It is not as good as the book, but still a decent movie. I would recommend watching it, but if you are expecting an accurate reenactment of the book, you will not get that. I would rate it 3 out of 5 stars, considering both the source material and the actual movie alone. This expresses the importance of being accepted to everyone, so important to show kids but when they are at a mature age. I would recommend showing it to highschoolers because they would be able to understand it and are mature enough to handle the content. I recommend it to anyone who wants a perspective into what life was like in 1964 and also experience strong and deep elements such as motherhood and racial discrimiation.", "publish_date": "2008", "category": "Drama"}, "index_50": {"review_id": "rw5390342", "reviewer": "Horst_In_Translation", "movie": "the conversation", "rating": "6", "review_summary": "A pretty tense movie that succeeds especially from the audio perspective", "review_date": "8 January 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "\"The Conversation\" is an American movie from 1974, so this one had its 45th anniversary last year and it was written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it came out the very same year like the second Godfather movie, which perhaps took a bit of attention away from it back then. But not too much because it was still a big player that awards season. Coppola, who just turned 80, was nominated for Best Picture as well as Best Screenplay and funnily he won both categories with his other movie and that is maybe a pretty unique feat. But he won the prestigious Palme d'Or for this one here instead. And there was really a lot more awards recognition. I don't want to go into detail about it as you can check for yourself, but one thing that deserves to be noted is that Gene Hackman, already an Oscar winner at that point, was nominated for a Golden Globe for drama acting, but did not get in at the Oscars this time. By the way, he will turn 90 in less than a month and he has exactly 100 movies in his body of work. There are probably not many movies where he really is the movie 100%. Here it is the case: He is in pretty much every scene from beginning to end in these almost two hours and even if there is a lot of story and plot in here, even a major plot twist, it never feels as if it is about anybody else but Harry Caul I must say. He is a private investigator or surveillance specialist you could say and we follow him as he works on his most memorable case perhaps. He is in charge of watching and recording a young couple and as we find out towards the end, the one who gave the order is the woman's boyfriend or husband and a very rich and powerful man. This constantly results in Caul being worried about what he might do to her/them when he sees and hears the material. This is why he initially only wants to give it to the man himself (which probably also has to do with his professionalism), but eventually is not sure if he should give it to him at all because of what may happen. But what actually happens is the exact opposite. It is not the man killing the two, but the two killing the man and actually, as we hear them talk about a specific time and location, I did not find it too surprising honestly. Or at least not as surprising as Caul did when he realized what happened. I even thought that maybe they want to frame him when he gets his finger prints all over the place there, but this never became part of the story. Instead it developed in a whole different direction.Still I want to talk a bit about the murder first. Or really about Caul's perception of what could happen. How wrong he was is really a perfect example of how bad he is with human relationships and interactions. He sees all the wrong signs. There is evidence of that on many other occasions. The best example is the pen, a nice gesture actually and he suspects something initially, but still takes it. However, when he is exposed, he gets really mad. His friends there, or maybe I should say \"friends\", see him as a bit of a genius. They respect him for who he is and they know he is working like the ultimate clockwork. But it feels as if they do not really like him. There is a pretty mean statement about loneliness right at the beginning of this scene directed at Caul. And with the interactions in general, also between the other pretty experienced surveillance expert and him, there is respect, maybe admiration even, but they clearly don't like each other. Add to that the scenes in which Caul is around females, who seem to have an interest in him nonetheless, maybe because of how competent he is. But the way he acts towards them also shows that he is simply not good with people at all. There are more examples, like the argument with Cazale's character. And how he loses him basically because of that pretty much, although he is the only one close to a friend he got. Says it all that the only birthday card he gets is really unpersonal and comes from his bank. By the way, I felt that the character looked older than 44, but this was Hackman's real age, or even a year younger back then. Anyway, as for Cazale, people keep saying he has a perfect body of work with all the films he was in and that is certainly true. There is no failure in there, which of course also has a lot to do with the sad fact that he died so early, less than five years after this movie. But I am glad he left us all these great films. This one here is maybe the least significant looking at his performances. He does not have a whole lot of screen time and his character is not too significant at all. It's all about Hackman like I said. Still Cazale comes up with the only slightly humorous scene in this movie very early on as we see him spy on two hot girls in a lustful manner without them being able to see him, but this scene is not just somewhhat funny, but also has a purpose, namely to show us how Caul is again 100% professional and does not want the surveillance interrupted because of stuff like that. I already said one or two things about his relationship towards women, but I can add here that he also does not like to be asked things by characters, female characters especially, like they want to get to know him better and show that they care about him, but he feels as if they are collecting information or so about him. The emotional connection between two humans is missing completely for him almost.Okay a few more things I can add here. For Coppola, it was a reunion with Cazale this time and also with Robert Duvall as both played crucial characters in the Godfather (then) duology. But Duvall only has one scene in this film we have here, well brief moments near the end too, but just one real scene. Also the really young Harrison Ford is in here, not too long before he entered the Star Wars universe. Three years to be precise. The song \"When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)\" is catchy enough for me to listen to it more frequently in the future, also a really, really old tune. Cindy Williams is really stunning. Her character's talking with her lover is what the title includes. We hear these words many many times and still it does not get old or annoying one bit, which is definitely a success because really the entire film revolves around these words, which is really not much more than five sentences or so. This is a really bleak movie, there are pretty much zero moments that will make you laugh because of the script, but also because of the protagonist's seriousness. He is very stiff. But that does not mean Hackman was bad or anything. On the contrary, it is a pretty memorable character for sure, one of the most memorable from the 1970s maybe. And the result is also one of the smartest films from the decade perhaps. The only thing missing for me was really that I could make an emotional connection here, which maybe explains my not too high rating. But with \"smart\" I mean that they used so many clever references and parallels. For example I liked the mention of the exact procedure how Caul opens doors and then we see it at least once later on, maybe twice. Don't exactly remember. And finally, when he basically destroys his own apartment because he is sure there is a wire hidden somewhere, but he cannot find it. Maybe he only imagined the call and that they know who he is and that he knows about everything. I mean there are definitely signs that he is paranoid, maybe even psychotic. Or maybe he really heard it, but then where is it? Perhaps in the saxophone somewhere? I mean he checked everything else, didn't he? But one reference why I really, really liked this movie is fairly minor, but also has to do with this final scene because early on there is talk about somebody having a key to his apartment in case of a fire or so, but he says there is nothing inside that he owns and he does not want anybody else in the apartment at all. And at the very end, it is not a fire that destroys everything, but it is himself. He totally cannot deal with being in the position himself where he is the one people are spying on because it comes with considerable helplessness and somehow you are at the other person's mercy and if the other person is a killer, then this is even worse. But it does not matter too much. It is already bad enough for him that he was at the receiving end of this little joke with the pen that really hurt his dignity. He is not one who brags about how great he is, but he certainly sees himself as a bit of a Messiah in his profession, which we also see when he calls another pretty new gadget junk and he also only builds his own stuff and does not buy other people's creations for his work. We see that at the convention when there is this one guy who is really friendly and seems to admire him a lot, but he is cold-shouldered by Caul. Overall, I think this is a film where you will find something new every time you see it I'm sure. It's a pretty good watch, but somehow I feel that even if I watch it another five times, it will still not be in \"great\" territory for me, just \"good\". So I have no intention to check it out once again anytime soon. I think today was the second time I saw it, first time at a theater. And on a final side note, I am surprised that this movie was not nominated for an Oscar in the sound category. I think the sound team did a really marvellous job there and they clearly had to deliver high quality given the film's subject. And they did. I felt like being right next to Caul listening to these recordings hearing the scratching etc. All in all, I give this film a thumbs-up. Go see it if you like 70s movies. Some say it was the best decade ever in film. And this film feels really very 70s to me given the costumes, people's looks etc. Some feel as if taken right out of a left-wing RAF film or so. And Hackman's character sometimes reminded me of Ulrich M\u00fche in \"Das Leben der Anderen\". I don't even know why. That's all now.

When I transferred from my first high school to my second high school at the beginning of sophomore year, I had a very difficult time with my director, with whom I ended up acting in three of his productions. We have made amends since and I sympathize with his perspective now. However, during my junior year, my spring musical was an environment of relentless pessimism, misanthropic communication, and passive aggressive condensation to the point where I no longer felt safe. My friends and I were overworked, disrespected, and no matter what we tried, no resolution was in sight other than the end of the production. I was overwhelmed by anxiety, stressed with the absence of leadership, and lacked self-esteem. Fortunately, I had some very dear friends by my side to help me through this strenuous period in my life, reaching out to my feelings and helping me understand that I was not alone The experience, however difficult it may have been, brought me closer to my friends, and I cannot thank them enough for making me feel cared for and protected.After the production was (thankfully) over, I started rehearsals for my adjacent town's community theater production of \"Grease\" immediately after. Although the first rehearsal I attended was a little late into the production process, no more conflicts interfered with the schedule of my school's show, so I was ready to start a new chapter. As soon as I stepped into the doors of rehearsals for \"Grease,\" I already recognized a significant juxtaposition between the two environments. The rehearsal process was practically therapy for me after my last show, for not one speck of cynicism was to be found in the working conditions. The director showed leadership, organization, and respect for all of us cast and crew members involved. My cast mates were all interested in getting to know me and letting me get to know them. Rather than feeling like I was trapped in an environment of toxic hostility, I felt part of a welcoming community who took my feelings into consideration. Being part of \"Grease\" was a lovely reminder of just how much of a difference people can make when your efforts to reach out to others finds you a group that looks out for your well-being.That time frame really made me consider: what does it mean to be a friend or a companion for someone? I have always been a person whose self-esteem relies on people showing open affection for my feelings and emotions. Sarcasm and I do not go together. I am a very straight person, and I wish for people to be openly honest with me. I do not always have a clear idea of what someone might be thinking of my actions or how I'm being judged, so if I'm doing something wrong, I always wish that people let me know what they think up front rather than keeping their judgements in silence. My family understands this, and my friends understand this as well. Everybody is different in their own way, but what unites me with these people is our ability to identify with the vulnerability surrounding our sensitivities.It is for these reasons why Ari Aster's \"Midsommar\" has resonated with me so personally. I saw the film for the first time in November 2019, and despite its place in the horror genre, I was comforted by my takeaway from the story. I love movies that never distance themselves from their characters, which is exactly what \"Midsommar\" does for our lead, Dani. The screenplay never looks down upon her struggles and insecurities, neither does it condescend her wish for attention and care. We can understand her flaws, being that she's a little needy for attention and insecure without others giving her a clear sign of recognition. However, we can latch onto her state-of-being; her actions come from a wholesome standpoint of wanting to feel included, never really having a family, friends, or boyfriend that gave her a sense of home and comfort. Dani simply wants to feel loved, cared for, and understood, especially after all of the trauma she has gone through, which makes her all the more endearing to me.It is at the point where she is drawn into the Swedish cult that she is met with the acceptance she has always been longing for. As a result of her outreach towards the cult and being open to what they have to offer, they give her the reward of feeling belonged, embraced, and supported. I have always been very extroverted and very eager to converse with people, but I have not always received the same levels of interest from others in my attempts, which has given me difficult feelings of loneliness. However, when I have found those who are responsive to my extensions, I have really understood which people I am meant to stay connected with. It is through these feelings why I found Dani's arc and her journey deeply personal, to the point where I was almost tearing up by the end, something that rarely happens to me when I'm watching a film. Furthermore, Florence Pugh's performance always allows us clear insight into what Dani is faced with, so we are at all times given an honest perspective of how she deals with the effects of her experiences. It is the treatment and the presentation of our lead that makes Dani one of my new favorite characters in cinema.Additionally, as someone with a deep affection for the environment, I cherish Pawel Pogorzelski's cinematography and aesthetics of \"Midsommar.\" The beautiful, bright sunny weather against the clear blue sky and lovely green trees fully immerses me into the setting of this world. The score by Bobby Krlic exudes a vivid aura throughout, but the musical composition for \"Fire Temple\" in particular at the end is just wonderful. The direction at times reminded me of an Andrei Tarkovsky picture with its purposefully careful pacing and the absorbing beauty of its natural atmosphere. All of the other actors also do very well, with Jack Reynor demonstrating great bravery undertaking a very uncomfortable sexual situation and making a potentially unsympathetic role become surprisingly intelligible. He seems like a very amiable person from interviews, and I'd love to see where he goes with his passion for directing. It is great that after the negative reception of \"Transformers 4,\" he has gone on to really prove his talent in \"Sing Street\" and \"Midsommar,\" a good example of why it is important not to be too quick-to-judge because people can surprise you (I have not seen Transformers 4, by the way, and I do not intend on doing so).It had been exactly one year, but last night in November 2020 I decided to rewatch \"Midsommar.\" I was a little nervous that the film would not hold up, that it would be an example of something which was popular and got people talking about its takeaways when it was released, but did not have much to offer upon a second viewing. Additionally, I've spoken to a good friend of mine quite a few times about \"Midsommar,\" which he did not enjoy. He felt like the film from a narrative perspective did not really have enough thematic depth to say anything particularly meaningful other than trying to give audiences a bizarre sense of unease, which in that respect also did not do much for him.I suppose if you're looking for a horror film, or just film in general, with multiple layers of subtext and numerous allegories to universal discussions, maybe \"Midsommar\" doesn't fall entirely into that category. However, I think it succeeds in what it attempts to accomplish because it is fueled entirely by emotions. There is logic that goes into making these emotions effective, but its main objective is to present feelings that give us insight into ourselves as people. In that regard, I think that \"Midsommar\" has a lot to say that is meaningful, which came from the perception that I felt like I was watching my inner feelings being projected on the screen. I contemplated what I relate to in people, what my attachment to Dani means about me, and why I had been given great reward through my time invested.I loved this movie when I first saw it, and I love it even more now. I get the feeling that for me, it will have great longevity.", "publish_date": "2019", "category": "Drama,Horror,Mystery"}, "index_52": {"review_id": "rw3473537", "reviewer": "dave-mcclain", "movie": "the nice guys", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "\"The Nice Guys\" is more than just a \"nice\" way to spend a couple hours.", "review_date": "21 May 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "I'm really excited about this one! Sometimes I'm concerned that the movies I reference in my reviews may be too old or too obscure to really help the reader understand the point I'm making, but never before have I come across a group of movies that represent the movie I'm reviewing so remarkably well, or that are so surprisingly well connected to each other! Let's look back at the fall of 1997. Just three weeks apart, two great movies came out which would both go on to receive multiple Oscar nominations and were both set in Los Angeles in the mid-to-late 20th century. \"Boogie Nights\" dramatized the porn industry in the San Fernando Valley from 1977 to 1984, as shown in the rise and fall (pun intended) of young porn actor Eddie Adams, a.k.a. \"Dirk Diggler\" (played by a rising star named Mark Wahlberg). This movie is notable for its excellent screenplay, terrific acting from a fantastic cast (which included Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy and then relative unknowns like Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Don Cheadle) \u2013 and for the film's realistic portrayal of late 70s' and early 80s' L.A. \"L.A. Confidential\" had come out three weeks earlier and painted an equally vivid and nuanced picture of the City of Angels in 1953, complete with government corruption which involved a character played by Kim Basinger. Fast forward to 2014. The Oscar-nominated \"Inherent Vice\" tells the story of a private eye (Joaquin Phoenix) who is investigating a case involving multiple missing persons in 1970 L.A. That movie was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who had also written and directed \"Boogie Nights\". The darkly comedic 2016 film \"The Nice Guys\" (R, 1:56) has a private eye looking for multiple missing persons, while uncovering connections to the porn industry AND government corruption in 1970s Los Angeles AND a character played by Kim Basinger is an important part of the plot. Boom! So, are those some really cool connections, or is it just me? Oh. Just me. Alrighty then. I'll just review the movie\u0085 The title characters in \"The Nice Guys\" are\u0085 kind of nice, relatively speaking\u0085 when you understand that they do some not-so-nice jobs. Jackson Healy (Oscar winner Russell Crowe) is muscle for hire. He beats people up (or worse) for money, but he's relatively polite when he does it and he feels kind of bad about it. (Well, he feels that he's cut out for more than, say, roughing up a guy whose messing around with a client's teenage daughter, and he wishes that he were doing something different.) Holland March (past Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling) is a private eye who seems to make most of his money half-heartedly investigating far-fetched missing persons claims by little old ladies. He's very polite in dealing with his clients and he's sorta smart, but he's not as tough or skilled as he acts, and he has a real problem with pain and with the sight of blood \u2013 especially his own. Regardless, Holland makes a good living and takes good care (financially, if not emotionally) of his teenage daughter, Holly (Angourie Rice). Holly is smarter, tougher... and nicer than Holland, whom she reluctantly \"parents\" better than he parents her.Holland is simultaneously investigating an alleged sighting of a porn star named Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) \u2013 two days after she was supposedly killed in a car accident \u2013 while also looking for an even younger woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley), who is a protest organizer, who may have appeared in \"an experimental film\" with Misty Mountains, and who definitely does NOT want to be found. Jackson, on the other hand, has been hired by Amelia to get this PI named Holland March off her trail. This situation leads to an inauspicious first meeting between Jackson and Holland, followed by an auspicious second meeting when they decide to join forces and use their respective talents to find out what's actually going on. You see, Holland has recently received an unwelcomed visit from a couple of thugs (Beau Knapp and Keith David) who demand to know where Amelia is, and then people who are connected to Amelia and/or Missy start dropping dead at an unnatural rate. Our titular \"nice guys\" eventually meet a Justice Department employee (Kim Basinger, an Oscar winner for \"L.A. Confidential\") who hires the pair to find Amelia, just as they discover that a Mafioso (Matt Bomer) from New York is in L.A. looking for them \u2013 and he ain't interested in talking. With Holly forcing her way into the equation to help her dad and his new partner, it's a race against time to find Amelia and figure out who's killing her acquaintances (and why) before those really not-so-nice guys catch up with the two relatively nice guys.\"The Nice Guys\" is a quirky, darkly comedic and intriguing whodunit. The script, by Shane Black (who also wrote \"Iron Man 3\", \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\", \"The Last Boy Scout\" and the original \"Lethal Weapon\") and newcomer Anthony Bagarozzi, is intricate, but not hard to follow, and contains smart and very funny dialog and situations (including great tie-ins to TV's \"The Waltons\" and President Richard Nixon), plus a mystery that's engaging but suffers from an awkward final resolution which feels forced. Besides co-writing, Black (who also directed \"Iron Man 3\") directs this film with a good feel for pace, tension and comic timing, while his very talented cast (especially Gosling, Crowe and Rice) really brings it all together. While similar in content to those other three films mentioned earlier, this one is closest in tone and style to \"Inherent Vice\", but is more accessible and less flawed. \"The Nice Guys\" is more than just a \"nice\" way to spend a couple hours \u2013 it's a pretty damn entertaining one. \"A-\"", "publish_date": "2016", "category": "Action,Comedy,Crime"}, "index_53": {"review_id": "rw5915916", "reviewer": "rnixon-15663", "movie": "underwater", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "Underwater", "review_date": "18 July 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Underwater\n2020\n15\nDirector: William Eubank\nStarring: Kristen Stewart, Vincent Cassell, Mamoudou Athie, TJ Miller, John Gallagher jr, Jessica Henwick etcOverall rating 86/100Underwater is based on a crew of oceanic researchers working for a deep-sea drilling company, try and get to safety after a massive earthquake hits, but they are not alone under the water, they must fight for their survival. I had a great time with Underwater and was on the edge of my seat throughout, I am really warming to Kristen Stewart now so lets talk about this more in detail,First of all, I thought the concept was great, as well as the cinematography and use of sound. I thought the whole concept of the movie was really interesting and well explored, the jobs of all the characters and the plot was just really interesting to me and despite the plot similarities I had never seen it done in this kind of setting before. The cinematography was also fantastic, despite a large portion of the film being CGI I still found it fantastic to look at. The underwater sets and the wide range of different locations kept you constantly entertained and some of the visual creativity was great as well. I also really liked the use of sound throughout, the film did a really good job at creating sound or effects without you knowing the source of where it was coming from, this kept me constantly on edge and nervous, the lack of sound in some scenes was also very effective in creating a frightening atmosphere.My next few positives would be the tense tone, Jumpscares and creature designs. The movie managed to execute an extremely excellent tense tone throughout. You were constantly on edge not knowing when anything was going to happen, one of the main reasons for this was that they played on peoples fears really well. The film played with fears of drowning and claustrophobia and made that part of what made the film so tense and scary, so this was very cleverly done. Also, the Jumpscares were very well executed. They weren't predictable like in some horror movies, they were well earned and unexpected. The creature designs were also really interesting and terrifying. They looked genuinely scary, and it made you connect with the characters more due to the fear of watching them let alone actually being there in the movie.My next few positives would be the gore, likeable characters, and the great lead performance. I thought that the film used gore very effectively throughout. It wasn't used often but I felt that it was deliberately done to create more of a shock when there was. And they definitely achieved this with some intense gore scenes that made you empathise with the characters and feel genuinely scared for them. All the characters were also very likeable, and all had at least one part of their personality that made you like or connect with them. This improves the experience of the movie because you don't want anything to happen to the characters there making you feel even more tense and on edge. Kristen Stewart also did a fantastic lead performance here, she showed versatility here, and her character was very likeable, and I believed every emotion that Kristen showed throughout, showing that her acting ability is improving in every new role that she is in.However, a few negatives that bought the film down slightly was the lack of background to the plot and characters, and the lack of depth to the plot and characters, as well as sometimes having an inconsistent script. The film went straight into the action which we will talk about soon, in some ways it was a good thing, but it meant that the characters and the plot didn't really have any background at all. We didn't know anything about the characters, or really anything about what was going on in the plot,, so this was slightly odd for me and made the film hard to connect with at first, The plot and characters were also sadly very self-explanatory and lacked any real depth or development, This was a shame as there was so many great components to the film but this bought it down slightly. The script was also at times inconsistent and not always the strongest. There was some plot holes and lack of description within the script to give the audience a proper understanding of what was going on, and some of the lines were slightly awkward and generic for this specific genre and didn't always work.My final few positives would be how the film went straight into the action, there was some attempts at depth to the main character and the final act was fantastic. The film didn't mess around when going straight into the action which I appreciated, it made you on edge straight away and that feeling never went away, so they executed there desired tone and atmosphere right off the bat, there was also some attempts at depth with the main character which I appreciated, they gave Kristen Stewart's character some slow building of background to her character throughout, we slowly learned more things about her family and reasoning behind her behaviour which made you feel connected to her and want a positive ending for that character. And finally, the final act was great. They really went all out underwater horror which I loved, it felt well earned after the slow building of tension throughout and exploded that tension out into a very entertaining and satisfying final act of which some things you won't see coming.Overall, despite a few depth and script issues, Underwater is a very good thriller/horror that achieves a perfect tone and atmosphere throughout and made even better with the fantastic main performance from Kristen Stewart.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Action,Horror,Sci-Fi"}, "index_54": {"review_id": "rw2985947", "reviewer": "mrrockey", "movie": "terminator salvation", "rating": "4", "review_summary": "Just Like a Machine, Technically Well Made, but Heartless", "review_date": "24 March 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "I remember watching Terminator Salvation right when it came out with the film leaving me very cold and empty after watching it. I didn't hate it, didn't love it, it just left me cold. After revisiting this film a few days ago, things haven't changed.Plot: In 2003, death row inmate Marcus Wright signs his body over to Cyberdyne Systems for medical research after execution. A year later, Skynet becomes self-aware and destroys much of humanity. 14 years later, John Connor discovers human prisoners and schematics for a new type of Terminator yet to be known to him. Meanwhile, Marcus suddenly wakes up and finds himself lost with no idea what happened to him but meets a young Kyle Reese and a mute little girl, Star. After hearing a radio broadcast from John, they go together to try to find him but Kyle and Star end up getting captured by Skynet, so Marcus ends up going instead with a resistance fighter by the name of Blair. But when they get there, Marcus accidentally steps on a mine and gets smoked but survives due to having robot parts inside him, he didn't know he had before.The first big problem with Terminator Salvation is the story. It seems like the writers have no idea how to progress John's character, or expand the mythology of the Terminator universe. John Connor in this movie basically has NO development whatsoever. All he does is deliver exposition about the plot and occasionally get into an action scene. He basically has no place in this movie's script whatsoever other than that he's John Connor, so the audience expects to see him. The plot itself also feels like filler, without much of a point to the overall outcome of the series. It's like the writers have no idea what to do after T3 so they just said \"Eh, who cares, let's just write a story that has little to no consequence so we can continue to write more of these and make a bajillion dollars.\" The best example of this is the 30 minutes of the film where they discover a radio signal that can shut down Skynet's machines but midway through the film, they... never bring it up again. If you want to follow the mythology of the Terminator series, missing this film wouldn't be that big of a deal.The characters and the actors playing them in this movie are a mixed bag. Christian Bale just plays John Connor as a generic action hero, while speaking in his trademark Batman voice. He doesn't have much personality beyond that, he's just really bland. The only moment where he gets to shine is when he delivers a speech at the end. Marcus is supposed to be the emotional center of the film as he's the character who goes through the biggest arc but the problem is, Marcus is really unlikable. I'm not sure should I blame the script for this, or Sam Worthington's performance but either way, Marcus just came across as a huge douche the way he constantly shouts at people around him for no good reason and generally acting like a prick. I actually wanted to see Arnold rip his heart out, THAT'S how unlikable he was. Moon Bloodgood did a fine job as Blair Williams, even if she looked a little too clean and model-ish to be a soldier. But the best character has to be the young Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin. I really BELIEVED this guy to be the younger version of the hero of the first film, Yelchin did a spectacular job mimicking Biehn's mannerisms but also playing his character differently enough to convince us that he's a younger version.The tone of the movie is another problem. While I like how much more SERIOUS this film felt when compared to T3, which felt too jokey and almost like a PARODY of Terminator at some points, they also go way too far with it and end up creating a really dull film. No matter what kind of movie you're making, you need moments of humor and emotion in your film to make it feel real but this film just had this constant moody tone to it that made it feel as inhuman as the robots in the film. There's practically never a moment for you to take back and laugh a little and there's not a whole lot of human emotion felt in this film. Compare that to the first two films which, were action-packed movies, but also took time to have some levity and human emotion with scenes like the Terminator learning to smile in T2, or Kyle revealing to Sarah that he came back not because he was ordered, but because of love. Scenes like this make the action more exciting as the story feels real and it connects with the audience on an emotional level as well so when the big car chases DO come in, the audience is genuinely invested as opposed to just \"Explosions! Awesome!\"If there's anything redeeming about the film, it'd be the technicals. The cinematography has a very gritty, greyish look to it that helps sell the despair that the characters are feeling and the special effects are surprisingly convincing. They made good use of both CGI and animatronics for all the different Terminators and the way they blend together is very smooth and seamless. The action feels appropriately gritty and brutal while not showing a whole lot of blood. And props to McG for not using shaky-cam like so many rubbish action directors working today.Overall, Terminator Salvation just seems confused. The writers seem to have no idea how to continue the story so they just end up creating a filler story. It's a good film on a technical level but it lacks heart. If you just want an action movie, you'll get it. But if want you something more, then keep on looking. 4/10", "publish_date": "2009", "category": "Action,Sci-Fi"}, "index_55": {"review_id": "rw2891010", "reviewer": "cultfilmfan", "movie": "gravity", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "Gravity", "review_date": "21 October 2013", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Originally going into Gravity, if I have to be honest about it, I was not quite sure what to expect and my expectations were not all that high. Seeing the early trailers for the film made me a bit concerned that the film would either be incredibly boring and just another long line of excuses in using this 3D technology for effects and what not, or that the film would be kind of like the summer spectacle films released that have big star power boasting it as well as a lot of special effects and action scenes and quite frankly I was not interested in seeing a movie like what I just described. On the other hand there were tons of reviews by critics and users online calling it one of the best films of the year and some calling it one of the best science fiction films of all time. The great reviews did peak my interest a little bit and I finally gave in and went to see Gravity. My thoughts? Overall, pretty impressed. The film was not boring, or self indulgent with special effects as I had worried that it may be and also it was not action scene after action scene with endless and ridiculous special effects either. What, I got instead was a more quiet and subtle film, but nonetheless one that packs an emotional punch. To either compliment, or ridicule the special effects and visuals of the film, would not be right seeing as I opted out of seeing the film in 3D and instead just saw a regular projection booth version of the film. While some of the cinematography and visuals were impressive, I think they would have even been more so in 3D and that is where a lot of praise from critics and online reviewers are coming from, so seeing as I did not see it in that medium, I will stay out of that debate and just say that what I did see was impressive, but that with most films like that, that it was neither here, nor there for me and the effects neither added anything, nor took anything away from my viewing experience either. Gravity, is above all a film about survival. I will not go into any more details than that, so you can enjoy this spoiler free review and discover the film on your own if you decide to do so. The film has a shorter running time and while sometimes I like films to have a bit of a longer running time to add more character and depth to said films, I personally found that keeping Gravity, at the length that they did was not only a good decision, but one that suits the film perfectly as well. Everything you could want was put into the 90 minutes of this film. You had really good character study as well as interesting storytelling and an added emotional content that I felt really helped create mood and both empathy and fascination in watching the characters as well. There were times, especially in the beginning of the film, where it got quite tense and I could feel myself going with the film into those emotions and feeling the type of dread and fear that these two characters are feeling. It wasn't the most pleasant feeling in the world, but at the same time I appreciated that the film had an affect on me like that and that what I was watching was connecting to me and myself to it as well. Going through their whole ordeal during the course of this film, I got scared for these characters, cared for them and at times were rooting for them to make the right decisions to save themselves and get to safety. The empathetic and emotional content really added to the overall feeling of the film thanks to some top notch writing and direction as well as the very impressive lead performances of the film. If, I have to be perfectly honest about it, I would have to say that nothing I have seen Sandra Bullock in has ever really wowed, or moved me in any way. That being said, I have not seen a lot of her films because they have never interested me and same with the style of performances she often gives as well. Keep in mind that I never saw the role that gave her the Oscar for The Blind Side. Perhaps if I saw that, I may feel a little bit differently. I have to say however that she completely held her own in this role and gave a terrific performance that is sure to earn her an Oscar nomination next year as well as perhaps the Oscar itself. She shows so much vulnerability and strength in this role, but we can still see how fragile and scared she is inside during the course of the film and how she tries to triumph that is not only interesting to watch because of the writing and directing, but also for her strong performance as well. It completely changed my thoughts on her as an actress and I hope she is allowed and chooses more projects like this where she is allowed to show this great acting range that she has. The film has a slower pace at times, but there is so much both visually and with the characters that you try and take in, that it is never boring and you are always watching with absolute fascination and awe. I credit the filmmakers for not making an action packed film with explosions and special effects and instead giving us a real story that looks real and feels real too. We feel what these characters do and their ordeal through this film is often felt on us the viewers which is not always an easy task to accomplish.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Sci-Fi,Thriller"}, "index_56": {"review_id": "rw5777673", "reviewer": "rnixon-15663", "movie": "extraction", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Extraction", "review_date": "27 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Extraction\n18\n2020\nDirector: Sam Hargrave\nStarring: Chris Hemsworth, David Harbour, Rudhraksh Jaiswal, Randeep Hooda, Pankaj Tripathi etc\nOverall rating 92/100Extraction is based on a black-market Mercenary called Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) who must go on his riskiest extraction yet where he has to save a young boy from two feuding gangs. I thought Extraction was excellent and there is so many good things to talk about so let's get started.First of all, the cinematography/visual creativity and set pieces were fantastic. Having the film set in India was a really interesting choice for an action movie and for me it really worked. The cramped streets were perfect for action sequences and the temples being beautiful to look at which is something that directors of action don't usually do. The film's cinematography and visual creativity was fantastic as well, the rich colours of yellow and orange were fantastic and the camera work was also excellent with the camera following the characters through some of the scenes and in the car chase scenes which created a great effect making you feel like you are in the movie with them.My next positives would be the film's tense tone, gore, and incredible action. The film managed to execute an excellent tense tone throughout, with the film managing to even make you jump on multiple occasions due to it's deliberate lack of sound making you on the edge of your seat for a large portion of the movie. The film's gore and action for me was some of the best parts of the movie. Due to the film's constant nonstop action you were consistently entertained throughout and never bored, the variety of different action scenes and the creativity within them were as good as John Wick without a doubt. And the excessive use of gore was fantastic as well and added to the impact of the action scenes with even me having to look away on a couple of occasions.My Only two nit-picks with the movie for me would be the lack of character background and the slight lack of depth to the plot. The film just went straight into the action in the beginning without any background information on the main character which I always find slightly annoying, we learned more as the movie went on, but it's always nice if you feel partly connected to the character before the action kicks in. And the movie did suffer from a slight lack of depth to it's plot, this is largely because the movie largely went for style over substance which fortunately for the movie is fine and perfectly acceptable, but it was very much one objective throughout leading to an end you were largely expecting so it would have been nice if they added a few more layers to the movie.My next two positives would be the character depth and the director not being afraid to cross near the line with child gang members. The movie went into a surprising amount of character depth with Chris Hemsworth's character that I wasn't expecting. His whole background of losing his son at a young age was truly heart-breaking, but it also made you understand his character more by how much he was willing to sacrifice in order to save the child that he became connected to, so this was well done. The director also was not afraid to cross near the line with use of kids in gangs. It was shocking to me how many of the kids were in the street gangs, but it also portrayed a more realistic portrayal of what gang culture looks like which I found interesting. The fact that the film was so willing to kill off the children was also shocking but made you dislike the antagonists more therefore doing a successful job.My final two positives would be the film's excellent performances and emotional weight. Chris Hemsworth was excellent in Extraction. He pulled of all the action sequences excellently which as an audience was well aware due to the marvel cinematic universe. But he really got his moment to shine here, but he also showed versatility with his acting as well with his characters more sensitive side. The debut performance (at least for me) of Rudhraksh Jaiswal was exceptionally good as well considering he is a much younger actor. The movie also had a surprising amount of emotional weight which I was not expecting as well, When Tyler opened up about losing his son it got to me emotionally which was a welcome surprise, and the fact that he saw his son in the kid really showed after he sacrificed himself to save him which I thought was powerfully executed, also with a clever link back to the beginning with the underwater scene with the kid at the end becoming like Tyler.Overall despite perhaps not having as deep of a plot as it could have had. Extraction is an excellent movie, with excellent creativity with its action and visuals, excellent performances and the blending of action and large amounts of emotion which is rarely used and was executed excellently proving that Chris Hemsworth definitely has an acting life outside marvel.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Action,Thriller"}, "index_57": {"review_id": "rw2929531", "reviewer": "emilyelizabeth1283", "movie": "take this waltz", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Director Sarah Polley", "review_date": "27 December 2013", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "If Sarah Polley were to make a career change, I would say she'd make an excellent teacher. And I don't mean she has a list of moral or artistic views for which her films are a vehicle, I mean Sarah Polley's projects reflect a pure distillation of a theme or emotion to focus on, and she somehow destroys all barriers between that message and the viewers. Whether you have a relative with Alzheimer's or not, by the end of Away from Her, you've learned about and connected the synapses in your brain to recognize that there are worse things, more painful things, in life that can separate two people than physical distance. So much of Polley's camera time is dedicated to faces and empty spaces. She lets a moment linger so that if you didn't feel it immediately from actual familiarity with the situation, you certainly get it after a few moments of watching Gordon Pinsent's face playing the part of Grant Anderson, husband to wife Fiona (Julie Christie) who begins to notice the worsening signs of Alzheimer's.The thing I love most about Polley's films is that in all three we are asked to look at the perception and stigma of infidelity from a completely different angle. This is most explicit and evocatively accomplished in Polley's second film, Take this Waltz starring Seth Rogen (Lou), Michelle Williams (Margot), and Luke Kirby (Daniel). Besides a great and nostalgic soundtrack, beginning with \"Green Mountain State\" (Corrina Rose and the Rusty Horse Band), the film introduces us to two of the central characters in much the same way as many Hollywood modern chic flick romance films, except that the dialogue and humor, to me personally, feel so un-fabricated and real-world hilarious. (I especially love the exchange between Margot and Daniel about drinking milk on a plane.) It is so reflective of a natural human reaction, to laugh at one's self in an awkward but fun situation, with no other reaction available to you, unless you are actually uninterested in carrying on the interaction...which is not the case here, and it carries effortlessly to the viewer. After we are done laughing with them and the hilarity of the coincidences that have brought them together, we have a beautiful slow-motion shot taken from the front as the two walk off of the plane into the terminal next to each other. The shot is long, the music is beautiful, signifying the birth of something unintentional but powerful. Polley lets you experience these moments right along with them. We are brought so close, it is intoxicating. Everyone can recall the moments of excitement after meeting someone and uncovering the sparks that lead your mind to wander like a little kid. Here's the interesting part: Daniel is not Margot's husband. We haven't even met her husband Lou yet. Instead, we are forced to make an emotional connection with Daniel. This beginning framework of the story makes for a wonderful emotional roller coaster ride that ends up slapping you across the face with reality and an ocean of gray where there was once a neat grid of black and white, and the complexity of emotion, attachment, and love.There is an exaggeration of childishness in Michelle Williams' character, but I appreciate the statement and illustration of the character through it. There are many wonderful moments that are meant to be reflective in an exaggerated light, sometimes this is the only way we see what's happening clearly. Near the end we get to the point of the film, conveyed to us through Sarah Silverman, who plays Margot's friend Geraldine, \"Life has a gap in it. It just does...You don't go crazy trying to fill it like some lunatic.\" (Incidentally this quote when I heard it in the film reminded me so much of the film Little Children with Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson, who are tempted to give up their responsibilities for the whims of an intense love affair)...funkyforestfirstcontact.wordpress.com", "publish_date": "2011", "category": "Comedy,Drama"}, "index_58": {"review_id": "rw2974543", "reviewer": "JasonDanielBaker", "movie": "night moves", "rating": null, "review_summary": "The Real Mystery Is Figuring Out That Some Likable People Do Bad Things", "review_date": "5 March 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Private investigator Harry Moseby (Hackman) has his hands full retrieving a teen runaway (Griffith) from the Florida Keys back to Los Angeles.

The most notable was James Cameron's scriptment, whilst the likes of David Fincher and Tony Scott were considered for the job. Raimi got the gig, directing a film that works as both an origin story and as a fun action flick. It's clear that he has a love for the source material and that he understands the larger than life aspects of the comic world. What we get is good fun with some big limitations. The films heart is in the right place and it's full of emotion, yet the writing is frequently sloppy and it does descend into campiness a little too much.Story: Nerdy teenager Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and develops spider-like abilities. He decides to use these powers to fight crime as Spider-Man once his uncle is killed. He is forced to confront businessman Norman Osborn whose evil alter ego is taking revenge on those who turned on him. The origin story is fairly simplistic, but I enjoy the messages it gets across. The 'great responsibility' stuff might be corny but it really works because the connection between Peter and his family feels genuine, whilst Peter developing and testing his new power is handled with care. Even though Peter's relationship with Mary Jane leads to some convolution I think it is handled well here. The Goblin plot is only where things go astray and that is mostly down to unclear writing.Hero: Tobey Maguire puts in a strong performance as Peter. What impresses is that he manages to capture the characters awkwardness whilst retaining an honest likability. His actions and motivations seem very natural. His Spider-Man isn't as witty or wisecracking as many want him to be, but I don't think that's much of an issue here. Villain: Willem Dafoe as Osborn proves to be extremely hit-and-miss. When Dafoe concentrates on the characters unease and the conflict within he is excellent, carrying a real sense of menace. The Goblin is just a hammy mess for the most part. Partly because the characters feelings and motivations are completely unfocused, partly because of some absolutely horrid dialogue and delivery. Support: Kirsten Dunst is good as M.J. She does have the girl next door vibe, while her motivations are clear and her relationship with Peter is built up with authenticity. I just don't like the way she is always a damsel and effectively becomes a plot device for Spider- Man to save. James Franco does a solid job as Peter's best friend and Norman's son Harry. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson bring a welcomed sincerity to May and Ben. A real standout is J. K. Simmons as Jameson in what is some of the best casting ever seen. He nails the role by being a wonderful mixture of deadpan, sardonic and arrogant.Action: The action is certainly a mixed bag. While sequences like the wrestling match and the montage of Spider-Man's activity are great fun, the main pieces are a bit of a let-down. The parade fight is harmed by some woeful CGI which makes the city look like cardboard. The climax is a cool set-up, but lacks any real heft and it ends up being a bland punching match. That said, the scene in the flaming building is brilliant and features some really impressive effects.Music: Danny Elfman provides a surprisingly effective score. It's much bouncier and more bombastic than his usual work, fitting the film extremely well and giving a real sense of excitement to the images of Spider-Man swinging through the city. His main theme is also very memorable.Production: I find Sam Raimi's direction to be a lot of fun. He always appears to know what a scene needs to give it an extra spark and the camera follows suit in that respect. In a number of areas the CGI holds up well, but in many areas they are badly dated with some of the action scenes are affected by this. Even though Spider- Man swinging through New York looks great, there is a lack of weight to his movements that makes it obvious that CG was used. As far as the writing is concerned, all feel that the more humane aspects are expertly handled, but the superhero material suffers. There is a lot of emotion to be found in Peter's guilt and his connection with Mary Jane, yet his heroic antics do come across as clich\u00e9d and don't fit what the film appears to going for at all. The Green Goblin falls foul to a number of especially bad moments, the finish it scene and the ''Sleep\u0085..'' line are just cringe-worthy in the worst possible way.Conclusion: So while it is probable that Spider-Man was the first big modern superhero film and did start a tremendously successful trilogy, I simply think that it is a decent film, nothing more or less. It does offer a lot of entertainment and a heart which many superhero films lack, but it's susceptible to falling down when it looks like it will soar. In Sam Raimi you have an appealing director and yet I don't think he is fully able to do what he wished. What we get is a script that becomes too cluttered and a villain that is way too campy when the majority of the film isn't. With Maguire we have an easy to like lead adding to a very solid supporting cast and I do enjoy the relationships the characters have. In a way I wish there was more of that emotion. Instead we get a film that just about manages to balance heart over silliness.", "publish_date": "2002", "category": "Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi"}, "index_60": {"review_id": "rw6081971", "reviewer": "rogus2006", "movie": "the big wedding", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "The Big Feel Good", "review_date": "10 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Robert DeNiro, and the late Robin Williams are marvelous in their roles and still \"got it going on\" to make you feel good. There are only a couple issues with The Big Wedding, written and directed by Justin Zackhman. For example, this movie is a big \"white\" in set-decoration and characters. The story does include about 25% diversity with Latino characters but sadly, no authentic Latino actors. It's not that they didn't try. An important character to the story is the adopted son Alejandro who was born in Columbia (real life British actor, Ben Barnes) and his biological mother from Columbia (Patricia Rae, US born and Columbian descent) & sister from Columbia (Ana Ayora, US born and Miami native). Patricia Rae is the closest we get to actor diversity. If you can forget all that, the issues raised in the story connect well with the audience because the sexuality is real, and the characters are believable - outlandish at times - but believable. My only other issue is that one scene is out of order after an intimate event between the DeNiro & Keaton characters. The next morning, the couple presents Alajandro with a meaningful wedding gift that began a long time ago and connects them emotionally. Th gift is the soul of the movie and no doubt will inspire real-life engaged couples to replicate. The problem with this scene is the next time we see DeNiro is at the wedding where he obviously fell-off-the-wagon. Wait, he was fine that morning and suddenly he's tormented. It's too much of an emotional shift, isn't it? The abrupt emotional shift within only a few hours could, but probably wouldn't happen in real life. Isn't it better that the DeNiro & Keaton's characters present the gift to Alajandro, go to the rehearsal dinner, have the sexual conflict, and then be tormented playout better logically? None the less, Katherine Heigl (Knocked Up), Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia, 2008), Topher Grace (That 70s Show) and Kyle Bornheimer (Marriage Story) help make the story come alive. Feel good endings are more important than ever because of the current pandemic, wildfires, inequality, and political climate. And The Big Wedding delivers a good ending. My husband and I laughed throughout the movie and we liked the happy, feel good ending that includes all the characters. With my husband related to the family values, issues raised, characters, actors, and the story and we wish there were more stories with this demographic appeal, but with diverse actors as well as characters.

The cinematography, music, acting, the simplistic yet emotional storytelling, all makes this an incredible experience. The film centres on two lost souls in Tokyo, both feeling culturally and personally isolated, and questioning their existence and purposes. Despite being at different stages of their life, they both form a strange but unprecedented connection, deeper and more real than most. I absolutely adored the cinematography and shots of late night Tokyo, producing a dim but dreamy and ethereal vibe, further emphasising the disconnection and isolation that the two protagonists feel. The atmosphere of the movie was heavy and morbid, as we experience the disconnection of the two characters from the world around them. Bill Murray was incredible, portraying a washed out movie star who is fed up of his life and his career. Somehow his expressionless faces conveyed so much emotion and sorrow. He looked worn out and tired throughout the entire movie, as if he didn't want to be here. I find it fantastic when actors can act without having to convey much in their emotions. Scarletts acting was also top notch, portraying a young and newly wed collage graduate already beginning to question her life. Their chemistry was strong and compelling, finding an unlikely solace in each others company, and soon they began to love the place that they had previously loathed. I love how the film shows that it's your connection with others and who you're with that change the way you look at a place. On their own, they struggled with communication and cultural assimilation with the Japanese, however together they were able to look past that and soon found the fun in it. Together, their alienation disappeared. The relationship was atypical and far from mainstream, making this movie much more thought provoking and real than the average Hollywood romance. The music was surreal and atmospheric, exuding the dreamy and hazel like vibe of the movie. I loved their nights out in the city, exploring the nightlife of Tokyo and having fun, thus becoming their true selves and taking on a carefree vibe. The ending was beautiful, adding a mysterious yet bittersweet feel to their last meeting, before finally going back to their old, dull lives. Overall, this movie transports you to a whole new world, something rare in movies.

A man falling in love with his operating system which isn't some physical form, but nothing but voice and thoughts. However, with me being a sucker for romantic films, I thought it was worth giving it a chance.Characters & StoryFor most of the 2 hours of the film, our focus is on Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who is a writer who works for a company which produced hand written notes for people. Theodore's specialty seems to be cards which express love and he has been with some families for years and has produced anniversary cards, amongst other things. But, while Theodore comes off as quite the romantic in his writing, his actual love life is in shambles. His childhood sweetheart Catherine (played by Rooney Mara) he is going through a divorce with, and though he goes on a date with a woman (played by Olivia Wilde), it seems the emotional impact of his divorce is making it hard for him to connect with another woman.Enter Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) who starts off as just an operating system, and evolves into a friend, girlfriend and then things get complicated. Theodore seeks out his friend Amy's (played by Amy Adams) opinion, but while she tries to be supportive, she is working on her own issues as she is in the beginning stages of her own divorce. Thus making it so the overall story feels like an analysis of the need for a connection, and a story which shows the difficulty of falling in love with a person and learning to continue to love the person as you, them, or both of you, evolve with time.PraiseIt is very rare for a two hour movie to not bore me, and yet Her somehow keeps you interested throughout. Be it the fact you just want to know what will happen between Theodore and Samantha, or just want to see more of Spike Jonze's futuristic world, there is just so many questions that you want the answer to, and so much you wish to see and get to vicariously explore. But, what I found strange though is the whole concept of a human and an AI in love. Though you can imagine this becoming a thing in the future, trying to adapt into a mindset where this isn't seen as weird, but sort of acceptable, makes you sort of open your mind a bit as you begin to like Samantha and Theodore as a couple.And what makes this work is the fact that there doesn't seem to be a lot of fat in the cast. Everyone has their place and with that, they all are able to help push the story forward. Adams' character is the best friend who helps give him a safe place to speak on the bewilderment of falling in love with an operating system without judgment; Mara and Wilde's character present the idea, that I'm sure some would have, that perhaps his issue is that he wants control and doesn't wish to really deal with a woman whose emotions aren't programmed to his liking; but yet, at the same time, the way Jonze writes Johansson's character makes it so that while you are likely to have your own prejudices walking in, he makes Samantha complex enough to make you feel conflicted about Theodore and her's relationship.CriticismAnd really, that prejudice is the only thing which really could keep you from getting into the movie. Being that most romance films feature two humans, you expect to see a range of emotions from more than just a person's voice. But, Johannsson does find a way to give a quality performance despite lacking a physical appearance. I will say though, a part of me is left wondering how much of this was merely for the sake of entertainment and how much was it social commentary? After all, the idea of a person falling in love with their computer doesn't sound too foreign, but I do wonder if it is supposed to be a critique of those socially inadequate?Lastly, I must admit the ending was sort of off for me. A part of me fathoms that perhaps Jonze didn't want to adhere too much to the usual trajectory romance films have. But, at the same time, though the ending wasn't ideal, it didn't ruin everything which happened before it.Overall: Worth SeeingI'm not sure how many movies I have seen over my lifetime, but I do feel like this is one of the few movies I may not mind seeing again. Perhaps it is because it tries to stand out as a film which draws me to think it is worth repeated viewing, or because the concept itself makes you think about more than what the film simply presents. Either way, I found it quite enjoyable and definitely think it is worth seeing, at least once. Spike Jonze's script explores an avenue not often taken and rather than it being written to mock, or even have a hint of prejudice, it is sympathetic and tries to understand the foundation of love and how despite how strong a foundation you can build with someone, or even something, things can still collapse.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_63": {"review_id": "rw3489189", "reviewer": "RLTerry1", "movie": "the conjuring 2", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Outstanding horror film!", "review_date": "17 June 2016", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Director James Wan has once again provided audiences with a brilliant work of the macabre and supernatural. From the writing to the directing to the acting and cinematography, Conjuring 2 is on par with, if not better than the first. Sometimes the best stories are true ones. And, although elements of the story have to be fictionalized in order to construct a cinematic narrative, grounding the Conjuring movies in the real work of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga) infuses a dynamic emotional response that directly impacts the increased frightening nature of these films. One of the observations that I appreciate most about, not only this but the predecessor, is not relying upon the jump-scare to curdle the blood. Are jump scares part of the movie? Well, of course! What fun would a horror film be without the entire theatre gasping for breath, jumping, or screaming together??? But Wan goes beyond the jump scare and channels his inner Hitchcock to build suspense and intrigue. The horror film is best appreciated in a group setting. It is a genre that specifically engages the audience on a visceral level. Wan is truly a master at his craft; and I love witnessing how he continues to prove his ability to develop creative horror films.Following the increasing trend for a film, including but not limited to horror, to begin with an elaborate prologue, Conjuring 2 starts with a fantastic moving shot of the famous eyelet windows of the 112 Ocean Avenue house in Amityville. Often filmed from the outside, this shot sequence takes place inside the attic. A much more intimate feel, this was an excellent choice for establishing the case that launched Ed and Lorraine Warren into the public eye. There have been numerous movies and documentaries based on the arguably most infamous haunting in the United States, so it was not necessary for Wan to spend too much time on it. It is, however, a very important scene because the plot/case of Conjuring 2 is directly related to the experience that the Warrens went through during the Lutz investigation. Beyond the establishing a connection between the Amityville and Enfield cases, beginning with the Warrens in the middle of the 112 Ocean Avenue investigation allows for Wan to visually show how and why the Warrens would seek a self-imposed sabbatical from supernatural and demonic investigations. Moreover, this sequence of events that provides copious amounts of plot development material are also instrumental in significant contributions to character development. Although this prologue lasts less than ten minutes, it contains prolific information vital to the plot of Conjuring 2.It should not be of surprise that Wan uses the camera very strategically to tell this visually driven story. From the rule of thirds to lighting to creative use of angles and movement, the camera is instrumental in setting the macabre mood of the film. One of the visual storytelling elements that Hitchcock was most known for, especially in Psycho, is using the camera's placement and angle to foreshadow something or someone. Wan takes a page from the Hitchcock handbook and utilizes the camera movement in such a way that you are predisposed to feeling certain that something or someone is about to appear or emerge from the shadows but your game is thrown off when that doesn't happen\u2013but then totally happens when you least expect it! Throughout the diegesis, you will encounter moment when the characters are faced with inner demons that parallel or symbolize the actual evil entities in the film. Having this subplot concurrent to the foreground aids in creating and maintaining an emotional connection to the characters. Shocking the audience both emotionally and physically. By eliciting dynamic and comprehensive responses to the horror on screen, the film becomes an immersive experience\u2013that is the brilliance behind this dark and sinister tale.Beyond the exceptional direction by Wan, part of what makes the Conjuring franchise so successful is the exquisite casting. Patrick Wilson (Insidious) and Vera Farmiga (Bates Motel) are perfectly cast in these films. From what I have read about the real Ed and Lorraine Warren, Wilson and Farmiga respectively stay true to the real-life people they are portraying while adding in the necessary acting skills necessary to increase the impact and believability of the film. The quality of the acting that Wilson and Farmiga bring to the film is outstanding. Sometimes, a horror film can have an compelling plot but the actors are so uninteresting that it prohibits the story from making the impression that it should. Wilson and Farming make the characters of Ed and Lorraine Warren interesting to watch and add a performance quality to the film that keeps your attention the whole time. The degree to which they add a sincere care for the victims of hauntings to their respective characters is refreshing and will stay with yowling after the movie closes. As the Warrens are reoccurring characters in the Conjuring franchise, it is vitally important that they are as interesting to watch as the plot itself since their cases are the inspiration for the whole franchise, at least put to this point.If there is one negative element in the film, it is the weak showdown. Not weak in that it was anticlimactic or uninteresting, but that it felt a little rushed. At 2hrs and 15mins, the film is longer than the average horror film, so it was not necessary to rush the climax of the film. It certainly does not mitigate the experience of the movie, but I feel that it could have been a little more intense. That being said, if you are looking for an excellent movie to kickoff your weekend, then this one is it!", "publish_date": "2016", "category": "Horror,Mystery,Thriller"}, "index_64": {"review_id": "rw0980944", "reviewer": "JAKastner", "movie": "spanglish", "rating": "4", "review_summary": "The Moose Hole - Review of Spanglish", "review_date": "18 December 2004", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "It's the most wonderful time of the year! True, the Christmas season is upon us but more importantly to the Hollywood left, who could giving a flying-hoot about a Christian based holiday, it is the season of giving and rewarding themselves. That is correct, it is award season! Though the nominations for the Golden Globes have already been handed out, there is still plenty of time for those last-minute additions to the 2004 film schedule to make an impact on the most prestigious award ceremony of the year, the 77th Annual Academy Awards. And who better to vie for the coveted spot on the nominations list then James L. Brooks, the man who creates the romantic comedies the Motion Picture Association can not help but eat up, no matter how gooey and clich\u00e9d they may be to some. This has yet been another light-weight year when it comes to award-worthy presentations \u0096 it is so hard without Lord of the Rings, is it not \u0096 and Spanglish, despite some rather negative buzz early on, may still yet be able to stir up some noise come this January.The story follows the events of an immigrant woman's life as she and her new daughter adjust to their new surrounds after moving to the United States from Mexico. Flor Moreno, a beautiful native Mexican woman left by her husband to raise her maturing daughter alone, makes the difficult decision to immigrate, illegally of course, to the United States for a better life for her small family. After entering the country, she and her young daughter make the long bus trek from Texas to southern California, moving in with her cousin in a heavily Hispanic ghetto. Concerned about her daughter Cristina's budding femininity, Flor decides to scope out a position as a housekeeper and is hired by John and Deborah Clasky who live in an affluent white neighborhood. John is a rising star in the culinary world and racked with the thought of Time magazine coming to his restaurant to review his work. He fears success, believing that if he receives four stars the only way to go is down and with the increasing attendance at his hot new restaurant that will mean less time spent with the family. Deborah, a former working woman, feels trapped as a stay-at-home mother, constantly battling with John for the good/bad guy parent position when it comes to rearing their children, usually receiving the latter. As cultures, traditions, values, and languages clash between Flor and her newly adopted American family, life changing lessons on marriage, parenting, love, friendship and family are learned on both sides. The story for Spanglish instantly becomes lost in translation, certainly no pun intended toward the vastly superior Academy-Award winning screenplay, lacking what matters to a film above all else \u0096 consistency, direction, style and heart. All of these troubling revelations become all the more difficult to swallow when one fathoms this rather dull, forlorn, and acutely humorless presentation is from the mind of James L. Brooks, the man behind such romantic comedy classics as As Good As It Gets and Terms of Endearment. No need to fret though. Even the best of directors in Hollywood have their off days and this seems to be the year for it with M. Night Shyamalan's The Village and Steven Spielberg's The Terminal being prime examples of this theory.It is revolting to see so many talented performers as there here have their respected gifts wasted like this, among them all Adam Sandler should stand out prominently in anybody's mind. Sandler, hardly a stranger to the dramatic comedy after astounding critics in his high-praised performance in Punch-Drunk Love, comes off as being intensely under-utilized in this film. He works out fabulously in the role and there appears to be quite some chemistry in his conversations with Pez Vega, especially when he opens up to her emotionally expressing what he can not say to his own wife whose perfectionist nature leaves no room to appear weak. Sadly, quantities of these sequences are limited and the audience never receives the full picture on John Clasky. In the end, instead of feeling happy for him, the audience leaves feeling sorry for the fact that the only woman he has ever felt a real connection with \u0096 not mere sexual attraction but emotional closeness as well \u0096 is leaving his life possibly forever and he is stuck with a woman that after a decade or so of marriage is just beginning to come around appreciating how good of a man he is, if only due to the enforcement of her alcoholic mother. Poor T\u00e9a Leoni! Her genuine and engaging performance as the perfectionist stay-at-home mother, Deborah Clasky, is so unfortunately wasted in this film. Deborah is so atrociously neurotic and undignified, even going so far as to border on the line of being flat-out insolent, the audience leaves the film wishing John Clasky would just divorce her and save the rest of the family the trouble of having to deal with her a moment longer. It's fantastic to see that Brooks is able to deliver such an absurd and retched character as Deborah, leaving the audience hating her guts with every compulsive move she makes, but the problem lies in the fact that he strips her of so much that there is no redeeming quality left about her to gain the respect of the viewers, let alone her husband, at the end of the film. And, furthermore, what is Brooks attempting to say with Deborah? What is with Hollywood and their inane belief that every woman who free-willing gives up her job in the workforce to be a stay-at-home mother falls into a deep and secluded depression, thus leading her to dabble into a sexual affair with another man? Paz Vega is positively illuminating as Flor Moreno, catching the audience's eye every time she appears on screen but, as painful as this is to say, that is as far as Brooks' direction, maybe even his script, allows her to be. There is hardly a quality or action about her that marks Flor distinguishable above the rest of the cast of characters outside the fact of being the only one that is rather dull and bland, based solely on actions rather then appearances. It may be the whole language barrier that fails the audience in connecting with her on an emotional level but considering John Clasky is able to somewhere in there, it is hard to believe that that is entirely the problem. This may once again be a direct result of James Brooks' poorly crafted and executed screenplay, which fails in its attempts to grab hold of a singular message and run with it to the end. And, yes, Ian Hyland does receive credit for the role of the Clasky son Georgie despite the clear and overt fact that he never once states more then a few words, beyond the realm of show-tunes with his grandmother, throughout the entire film. Hey, John and Deborah \u0096 when you're done dealing with your weight conscious daughter and your own marital complications, remember that you have a son somewhere in that household of yours.Overall, linguistic complexities being the least of their problems, Spanglish's audience is in desperate need of its own translator in order to decipher amongst the garbled mesh of clich\u00e9d cuteness and bland one-liners rattled off as deep philosophical thinking the message the film is attempting to express. The film certainly enjoys hedging its bets early and often, only to lose big-time when all was said and done. Does Brooks truly expect us to believe that such a sophomoric essay theme as 'Who do you admire most?' would appear on the application form for such a prestigious education institution as Princeton? And this is captured in the opening sequence of the film! On top of this, Spanglish's script, or what exists of one, sends confusing and complicated messages to the audience, none of which are ever clearly stated, let alone backed up with sufficient evidence to prove its point. Does this mean that every child who attends a private educational institution will lose his/her independence and identity? Every stay-at-home mother finds herself so entrenched in depression that the only way she can escape is by having a sexual affair with another man? And every illegal Hispanic immigrant who drops out of a private education and remains stranded in the public education sector of the state of California who sends in his/her essay to Princeton University will have it examined intensely for the sake of their own merit and not merely for the unethical method of affirmative action? And what is more insulting is that the actions of the film are excruciatingly bland and static. There is not a moment of real humor in the beginning of the film until about twenty or so minutes into the presentation. From there the jokes are few and far between and are usually aimed at the language barriers of the two illegal Mexican immigrants. There are so few actually gracious recommendations that can be made about this film that to list the meager amount that do exist would stray away from the undeniable fact that Spanglish is yet another tremendous disappointment this year from a respected filmmaker. Also, when escaping from the bottom rung of society in a country such as Mexico, screw the heritage bull-crap and assimilate quickly \u0096 everyone will be better off for it.My Rating: ** out of 5 (Grade: D)", "publish_date": "2004", "category": "Comedy,Drama,Romance"}, "index_65": {"review_id": "rw5522507", "reviewer": "davidmvining", "movie": "the world is not enough", "rating": "3", "review_summary": "The worst Bond movie", "review_date": "2 March 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "I...do not like this movie. It's too busy, so busy as to keep any real story from developing. I had lost interest by the half hour point, but I kept with it until the end. I was not rewarded for my patience. I understand that this film does have some defenders, but I don't see the merits at all. The good things are good ideas that are executed badly.It starts with a pre-credits sequence, like every Bond film, but this one is laboriously long, over twenty minutes. Bond has two separate action sequences. The first is in Spain and involves Bond jumping out a window with a briefcase full of money. Then there's a scene of dialogue, an explosion at MI6, and a chase over the Thames (where Bond actually goes into the water...ew). The actual story information passed along in this sequence is actually not that much (and some of it ends up going nowhere), which makes me feel like this is a first draft screenplay that was cobbled together from a couple of other existing drafts.See, the problem is the dual villains and the mystery box effort to hide one of the characters as a villain. We don't get introduced to either of them until after the credits sequence (so almost half an hour into the film), though there is a line of dialogue from the female sniper that features prominently in the opening bit that gets echoed in Skyfall when talking about a much more interesting villain. The first is Elektra King, the daughter of an assassination victim. She's presented as the sympathetic victim in the beginning (a typical Bond girl) and morphs into a heartless villain. Now, I like this idea, the subversion of the conceit of the Bond girl, but it doesn't work for a couple of big reasons.I see The World is not Enough as an effort to mimic and reverse the emotional success of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. George Lazenby's single Bond outing is the only time the Bond movies ever successfully created an emotional connection between Bond and a girl. Everything else has been superficial at best. There seems to be an effort to get Bond and Elektra to the same place, but there simply isn't enough time dedicated to their relationship. They're talking super seriously about desire and stuff within minutes of meeting each other. There's no real chemistry. Brosnan and Sophie Marceau do their best (Marceau is a quality actress), but the writing just isn't there. Much like Paris Carver in Tomorrow Never Dies, the movie never successfully gets them into a believable romantic spot.That would be fine if the movie treated Elektra as a typical Bond girl, but they had big ideas for her. She was the wolf in sheep's clothing and the actual antagonist of the film. Her betrayal of Bond was supposed to be an emotional gut punch, and it falls almost hilariously flat. It doesn't help that her very late explanation of her motives makes literally no sense. She's in control of her company, obviously able to do what she wants (as evidenced by an early-ish scene where she dictates her pipeline bypass a church despite obvious reservations from those around her), and she wants to...claim the company for her mother? I mean, killing her father and putting herself in charge fits that, but what about the rest of her plot that involves blowing up a small section of her pipeline with half of a nuclear payload while giving the other half to a French terrorist to blow up Istanbul?And that brings us to Renard, the French terrorist. He kidnapped Elektra years before, eventually letting her escape, and now he's in the palm of her hand, doing what she wants. The idea of his physical condition is kind of cool (the bullet slowly making its way through his brain, killing all physical senses). I mean, it's essentially leprosy with super-strength (somehow), but whatever. I can buy it. His motive and Elektra's are totally different. They have literally nothing to do with each other. He's a communist terrorist who rails against the West, and she's a decadent Westerner. He wants to blow up Istanbul because...reasons (because she told him to?). It's such a hodgepodge of underdeveloped nonsense that it has to have been cobbled together from different scripts. Maybe they wanted Elektra to be the antagonist, but they just didn't have enough material, so they pulled the Renard stuff from another draft and awkwardly grafted it all together.One thing you can usually rely on in James Bond movies is quality actions scenes, but here the movie falters as well. Michael Apted feels like an intelligent man, but he's not an action director. There's no sense of geography. Bad guys pop out of nowhere. We lose the sense of where everyone is constantly. It's a visual mess of nonsense that never comes together to tell a cohesive story of an action scene.And then you have Dr. Christmas Jones who is, well, she's there, and she's played by Denise Richards. I don't quite get the hate she receives for the role. I found her present in the film and little else.In the end, this film is dreary and dull. There's no real story. It lurches from one scene to the next with two antagonists that never gel, creating disparate goals that feel like they should be connected but aren't. The Bond girls are wastes of ideas. It's flatly filmed with terrible actions sequences.

Whether intentional or not Rosie's daughter is left with the impression that in her mother's eyes she does not quite measure up. I was left with the impression though that from the perspective of Aniston's character she was just trying to protect her daughter but that was not what the daughter was understanding. She assumed her mother was ashamed when she was just wrapped up in her world and maybe at times emotionally neglectful.The dynamic between the Will and Rosie felt real. Too often I will see an actress up on screen and she will have the obligatory child in the story but her moments with the child do not feel real. It is as if the actress has no idea how to connect with this young actor in front of them. I am thinking specifically of Ashley Judd in Double Jeopardy here. It is a good movie that falls apart when Judd must interact with the actor playing her child. She looked uncomfortable. Aniston came off as natural and quite comfortable. I give her credit for that.Danielle Macdonald does an amazing job. She gets you to invest in the character. I felt bad for Will as she was struggling with self-image problems and her relationship with Rosie that both had been avoiding dealing with while her aunt who recently passed was alive. The aunt was a surrogate mother to Willowdean and now that she didn't have that relationship to hide in she had to actually deal with the problems in their relationship.One perpetual thorn is that all of Will's friends call her \"Will\" with only her mother using \"Dumplin'.\" I can empathize with this as I had a childhood nickname that my parents used in front of everyone wherever we went, and it was always quite embarrassing. Macdonald's reaction as the character was authentic. Will also deals with feelings of inadequacy when it comes to workplace hunk Bo (Luke Benward) who is clearly interested in her but she cannot understand why.Willowdean and Rosie must also confront their feelings over the loss of Rosie's sister. She was the glue that apparently held everything together and her loss is exposing old wounds. This movie does a good job at exploring the void that the death of a loved one can create in a family.This is all set to an obsession Will and her late aunt had with the singer Dolly Parton which is shared to an extent by Will's best friend. It is a sweet and quirky little connection that is played very effectively and provides for a great soundtrack but then you really cannot go wrong with Dolly. Fitting in with the Dolly theme in this movie is a drag biker bar that was an important part of the life of Will's Aunt Lucy (Hilliary Begley).The movie is about the assorted characters coming into their own. They are either being who they truly are or coming to terms with emotional baggage. Will is finally confronting apparent resentment she never realized she felt towards her best friend Elle (Odeya Rush). Meek Millie Mitchellchuck (Maddie Baillio) is inspired by Will to finally pursue her dream she had since she was eight years old and enter the pageant despite feeling that her weight was a hindrance as well as stand up to her overprotective mother (Kathy Najimy). Hannah Perez (Bex Taylor-Klaus) gets to just be herself in front of the world. I felt her part was the least developed. Too often she was just the sarcastic friend.Dumplin' is done in such a touching way here. Normally these types of films can get overly saccharine or overly downbeat but neither happens here. You feel the character highs and lows, but it is never downbeat nor is the film a knock-on parents or families or institutions. It is merely the story of a young woman and those around her and the growth they go through during a certain period.The best part is they do not go for the obvious ending. Too often it is eyerolling and totally unrealistic. Dumplin' does not win the pageant, but she is still victorious in her own way by bridging the divide with her mother and finally willing to believe it can work with Bo along with making amends with Elle.There is a word that got tossed around quite a lot a few years back, but I have not heard it used too much recently. It is dramedy. That is what this movie is. It is a drama with plenty of comedic elements. It is serious but the seriousness is balanced out by lighthearted moments. You will laugh and it will tug at your emotions.Dumplin' is a very enjoyable heartwarming film adaption of the young adult novel of the same name. It has a great script with plenty of jokes and a significant amount of heart.

Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\" series is \"Day of the Dead\". While it is the third film in the original trilogy, fans of Romero will know that he did make more zombie films later in his career. This 1985 film raises the stakes in that the zombie Apocalypse that has engulfed the world has all boot wiped out small pockets of civilization. Humanity is on its knees and for all involved there does not appear to be any future scenario where the living may walk away as victors in a war that has been raging since Romero's first installment in 1968.Brief Summary:\nA military installation in Florida is trying to hold firm despite the onslaught of the zombies. Trouble is not far away though as scientist who are sharing the installation with the small pocket of military personnel have been pushing the experiments further than anyone dare imagine.Detailed Summary:\nOutnumbering the living 400,00 to 1, zombies are everywhere. Scientists are trying their hardest to find a solution to the global issue, and in one military facility in Florida, they live underground under the protection of a handful of soldiers. To conduct experiments the scientists keep a stash of zombies locked up under the base, there is a feeling that perhaps the zombies can be trained or made docile. When military personnel discover that their deceased colleagues are also part of the experiments they are far from happy, but what pushes the soldiers over the edge of anger is lax routines that allows zombies to break further and further into the secure zone. The scientists are stopped from continuing their experiments, the zombies break in and break out, and chaos ensues - it's a pity really because a zombie that was affectionately nicknamed 'Bub' actually displays some human emotions. Will anybody survive?Film Stuff:\nThe runtime on this film is 100 minutes and with a budget of up to $4 million this film is a much bigger proposition than where Romero's first film came from. Like those though this film was written by the Romero as well as directed, unfortunately though this film was hit with issues that affected the writing, the script, the budget and all sorts of things that forced him to change the image he initially had for the film. The film was still shot in Pennsylvania though, where the series began. Additionally, it was also shot in and around Florida too, using Fort Myers as its centre. The way it worked out, the underground scenes were done in Pennsylvania and overground scenes in Florida. Tom Savini returned in special effects for this film, which earned him his second Saturn Award for best make-up, but the conditions in the caves that were used underground hampered his equipment and props.Casting:\nThis film has more survivors at the start of the film than the previous films have. This includes Dr Sarah Bowman (Lori Cardille), Cpt Henry Rhodes (Joseph Pilato), John the helicopter pilot (Terry Alexander), Bill McDermott the radio guy (Jarlath Conroy), Dr \"Frankenstein\" Logan (Richard Liberty), and of course \"Bub\" the zombie (Sherman Howard). They all do a decent job without exciting or causing much of a connection. Pilato and Liberty both do good as pantomime villains to the piece (even if Dr Frankenstein though he was innocent and righteous), and Cardille, Alexander and Conroy are convincing enough as the people with a moral conscience who decide that enough is enough. While the script was well-written enough, I did not really feel any lasting connection to the main cast. They came across as stereotypical of their profession and a bit bland at times. With the other films I was able to form more of a connection, in this I was left just watching and not feeling their fears and concerns.Howard is ok as \"Bub\", but I felt that at times this was a flawed character. The semi-domesticated zombie only really served as an occasional comedic character, and occasional threat. Yes, he is a zombie and therefor probably should be flawed, but by humanising him it just made him a bit of let down for me.I must mention that Romero made an uncredited cameo in the film as a zombie with a scarf. He had previously appeared in a film in the series, but he was portrayed as alive in his previous cameo. Obviously that character died and made his way to Florida :DWrap up:\nI did enjoy this film, but honestly not as much as the previous two films. There was greater attention to effects with buckets more blood and gore, but beyond that the film did not feel as well constructed. Perhaps this is down to the restraints that Romero faced and the budget that diminished from what he had planned. There was not as much social or political commentary as the previous two, which really made them feel as scary as the threat of the flesh-eating hordes contained in them.There is still a sense of claustrophobia in this film, but it did not feel as confining as it did previously. I kind of felt that he surviving humans had doomed themselves from the off by being in a base which had underground parts - at least in the open countryside or a mall you have scope to escape, not when you are underground though. Perhaps this was a statement that missed; the dead do not live underground in caskets anymore, so maybe the humans should?At times this felt more of a soap opera with shouty people falling out with each other, what action-based scenes there were felt scattered randomly, rather than a smooth flow because of a well-crafted plot. While Romero stated in interviews that this was his favourite of the 3 zombie films, he made between 1968 and 1985 I tend to be of the opinion that was the weakest of the three. It is good, but it is not great. It certainly has the best effects, but it lacks a little more story. Maybe my disappointment is what actually makes the film a success, the main theme is futility and no hope after all. Humanity is the ultimate protagonist on display, and it is demonstrating through the scientists and the military, how quickly it is to destroy its own self, man's inhumanity to man.While I enjoyed this film favour the first two, despite that fact I still own a copy - it's still better than a lot of the zombie films that the 90's and 00's gave us.", "publish_date": "1985", "category": "Horror,Thriller"}, "index_68": {"review_id": "rw6452214", "reviewer": "msbreviews", "movie": "pieces of a woman", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "PIECES OF A WOMAN holds one of the most emotionally shocking opening acts of the last few years, and a career-best performance from Vanessa Kirby!", "review_date": "7 January 2021", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've never seen a movie from Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3, but Pieces of a Woman started getting the usual awards buzz that comes with this time of the year. Once Netflix grabbed the distribution rights, it was just a matter of time until I got the chance to watch yet another Oscar-bait. I didn't really think about it nor created any sort of expectations besides hoping it would be good. Vanessa Kirby (Mission: Impossible - Fallout, Hobbs & Shaw) and Shia LaBeouf (Honey Boy) are the protagonists of a story that will connect with many people around the world, especially couples who went through the same situation. I'll write it straight away: it's undoubtedly one of the best films I've seen this past year.How does it stand in comparison with the other marvelous movies? I'll have to think about it when organizing my Top10, but Pieces of a Woman possesses the best opening act I've seen in quite a long time. For thirty full minutes (even before the title card shows up), an entire birth scene is delivered through excruciatingly long, uninterrupted takes, which ultimately make the whole sequence feel like a phenomenal oner. Technically, the entire film is brilliantly directed by Mundrucz\u00f3, who takes advantage of the superb cinematography from Benjamin Loeb and Howard Shore's beautiful score to offer the viewer an emotionally powerful viewing experience.As fantastic as the technical attributes may be, Kata W\u00e9ber's exceptionally well-written, detailed screenplay is really elevated by the incredible cast, notably its leads. Without the shadow of a doubt, Vanessa Kirby gives her career-best performance, demonstrating an emotional range I genuinely believed she didn't have. Martha's arc ends up being a tad predictable and formulaic as some other characters' arcs and portions of the narrative, but I never felt less invested in the story due to that. In fact, I can't remember the last movie that brought tears to my eyes before the end of the first act, which serves as a statement of the film's realism and authenticity.Shia LaBeouf might have also delivered his best interpretation ever, even though I truly love a couple of his past displays. Once again, the actor brings his A-game, demonstrating the talented acting skills that make him one of the most underrated actors working today, in my opinion. A particular aspect of Sean's arc left me a bit dubious of its necessity and/or importance to the narrative, but just like Kirby's character, I was always interested in their path. Molly Parker is also excellent as the midwife involved in the tragedy, while Ellen Burstyn portrays Martha's mother, Elizabeth, leaving me deeply surprised by her outstanding performance. 88 years old... Magnificent.Despite the highly expected developments and respective conclusions, the ending shares a touching revelation involving a particular trait from Kirby's character that hit me really hard. The best aspect of the entire movie has a negative side effect, though. After such a mesmerizing, powerful, shocking first act, the rest of the film never quite reaches the same level of investment and immersiveness that the initial thirty minutes are packed with. Don't get me wrong, it's still a remarkably captivating narrative, filled with significant messages of forgiveness, acceptance, fairness, and another take on the \"moving on\" matter.It will be extremely hard to watch for many people, but it's that realistic environment that left me speechless and surprisingly emotional right from the get-go. It might not be a movie that I'll rewatch countless times or even recommend to every single reader. Nevertheless, Pieces of a Woman carries an undeniably impactful story that tons of viewers will share a deep connection with, which every filmmaker tries hard to accomplish. Ultimately, concerning my Top10, it will come down to how much I value its immense quality vs. its low replay value.All in all, Pieces of a Woman becomes a worthy awards contender, holding one of the best opening acts of the last few years. With astonishing direction from Korn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3, the first thirty minutes are packed with extreme levels of anxiety and stress due to the emotionally shocking birth sequence, which is played out through excruciatingly long takes. Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf deliver their career-best performances, handling extensive monologues effortlessly, but it's the former who leaves me mind-blowed at her emotional range, which induced tears in my eyes even before the title card. Kata W\u00e9ber's exceptional screenplay is brought to life in a remarkably authentic, immersive manner, leaving me incredibly captivated by its characters, despite the formulaic and predictable arcs. Huge praise to Howard Shore's wonderful score, and Benjamin Loeb's terrific camera work, as well as Molly Parker and Ellen Burstyn's excellent displays. I highly recommend it to anyone who'd love to watch an emotionally investing story with phenomenal acting but be advised: it can extremely hard to watch at times.Rating: A-", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Drama"}, "index_69": {"review_id": "rw2978618", "reviewer": "shawneofthedead", "movie": "the railway man", "rating": "6", "review_summary": "A good story, well-acted and well-told, but one that loses some steam as it trundles towards its final destination.", "review_date": "13 March 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "It's an understatement, really, to say that World War Two caused a lot of damage. The global conflict ripped through entire continents, and cost the lives of millions. Wounds - of the physical, mental and emotional variety - were inflicted, and many of them have never been healed, at least not completely. The Railway Man takes a long, affecting, but often slow-moving look at the scars the war inflicted on one man.Eric Lomax (played by Colin Firth in the present day and Jeremy Irvine during the war) is a lonely, gentle man who spends much of his day studying the train schedules of Great Britain. When he meets Patricia (Nicole Kidman), his life as a bachelor ends - but their newly-wed bliss doesn't last for long. Soon, Patricia begins to bear witness to her husband's crippling post-traumatic stress disorder. Worried that she will lose him to his nightmares, she reaches out to Finlay (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), her husband's war buddy, to find out just what happened to her husband during the war. The truth about Eric's suffering at the hands of the Japanese, particularly the coldly impassive Nagase (Hiroyuki Sanada), sets him on a path of vengeance - one that will take him back to the Thai/Burma Death Railway built with the blood, sweat and lives of Eric's friends and comrades.As war movies go, The Railway Man is less of an action-packed epic and more an introspective drama. It's told substantively in flashback, as Finlay explains to Patricia exactly what Eric went through as a Japanese prisoner-of-war. There's nothing wrong with that, per se. The flashbacks are beautifully shot, and Eric's ordeal is genuinely terrible to contemplate. The film's best moments don't come in shoot-outs or last stands, but in emotional confrontations between characters - such as Eric's gripping reverse-interrogation of Nagase - when pain, secrets and history are revealed in rage, concern or despair.But the introspection of The Railway Man can only go so far - the film takes a long, winding time to tell its story, frequently breaking up the emotional tension of its narrative. As a result, it's hard to build a strong emotional connection to the characters, with Firth's Eric, in particular, hermetically sealed within his own psychological bunker until the final third of the film. There's a moment of terrifically galling emotional blackmail involving Finlay and a railway bridge, but even that doesn't deliver the punch in the gut one suspects it really should.Firth is reliably excellent, although it's hard to shake the feeling that he's slightly miscast - he seems too young for the role of the real-life Eric Lomax, who made his journey of vengeance and unexpected reconciliation relatively late in life. Nevertheless, he's very good, especially in a moment when he shudders apart on the bedroom floor, trapped again in a nightmare he can't ever shake loose. Irvine, so stiffly square-jawed in films like Great Expectations, delivers his best performance to date as the brave, battered young Eric - providing not just an uncanny physical resemblance to Firth, but an effective emotional connection to his older self too. Kidman and Skarsg\u00e5rd are both good, although the former doesn't have much to do - her role is pretty much scrubbed free of personal history and colour - and the latter seems an odd choice to play an Englishman named Finlay.Like the trains so beloved by its leading man, The Railway Man is a solid, practical, well-built endeavour - it takes a long, scenic, sometimes torturous route through a story that could easily have been shortened, in any number of ways. But it does also have its own charms. Those patient enough to put up with the film's meandering plot will find a handsome, well-intentioned film with a story well worth telling.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Biography,Drama,Romance"}, "index_70": {"review_id": "rw2964752", "reviewer": "bray4-929-498080", "movie": "blackfish", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Blackfish is a documentary that is worth watching due to the home videos, interviews, and information it provides.", "review_date": "20 February 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Blackfish, directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, is an interesting, thrilling documentary. This movie is thought provoking and made me walk away wanting a better life for the whales that live in captivity. It was more than I expected it to be and not only told the story of Tilikum, but also showed everything that was wrong with SeaWorld. After watching this movie I will never take my family to SeaWorld. Due to the popularity of the movie, SeaWorld has lost revenue and artists have canceled playing at their annual concert. The movie was a success because the director used real footage to tell the story and is extremely informative in the facts.To begin with, Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) was a successful movie because real life footage was used and former whale trainers were interviewed. This proved the movie's validity and also made the viewer more connected to the storyline because they could give a real face to the character that the story was about. The New York Times talked about the movie by saying, \"Seemingly supported by chilling video and the oral testimonies of two witnesses to Tilikum's first attack in 1991, the trainers accuse SeaWorld of cover-ups and misinformation.\" The scenes of Dawn playing with Tilikum and loving her job made me emotionally tied to the movie and made me feel even worse about her death because she now seemed like someone I knew. However, the whole movie is not only real home video footage, there are also interviews and slight bits of animation. These provide a perfect balance for the viewer so that a story can still be followed. Shots from when a trainer was crushed by a killer whale were shown and although they may be gruesome, they are getting the point across that the whales can and do kill trainers. \"Through the rueful voices of former trainers and whale experts, a narrative driven by disillusion and regret unfolds as the trainers point to a gap between SeaWorld's public image and behind-the-scenes reality\"(New York Times). There is no other person a viewer would trust more than a former trainer to tell them the facts about how wrong SeaWorld is for treating these animals so badly. This is why the interviews during the movie are incredibly powerful. The interviews of how wrong SeaWorld is are then backed up by scenes of tour guides lying to the guest of the amusement park about facts about the whales lives. Watching the scenes and listening to what the former trainers said made me feel bad for the animals and made me want to do something to help the whales at SeaWorld after I walked away from the movie. Secondly, I would recommend Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) because it is extremely informative. Through the movie I learned many facts not only about killer whales, but also about how SeaWorld runs its business. Chris Sawin, a critic on IMDb.com, says, \" While 'Blackfish' is extremely informative it also reveals a little too much at times.\" Although some of the facts and scenes such as watching Tilikum's sperm get extracted by trainers can be a little to graphic, to me, it is part of the movie and it is better to tell all the facts in order for the viewer to get the full picture. This was an important scene to the movie because it was explaining how Tilikum's sperm is very valuable due to his size and ability to perform. Through Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) I also learned about the process in which SeaWorld goes about capturing the whales and separating them from their families, which they are closely connected to because of an extra region in their brains that focuses on emotional connections. The movie was informative and taught me about the whale's lives while living in captivity. In conclusion, Blackfish (Cowperthwaite 2013) was a well-made movie that provided the viewer with an extreme amount of information and also used video footage along with interviews of former SeaWorld whale trainers. The information was helpful because it gave me a better background of the whales. It also showed the correct facts about whales and how SeaWorld whales are suffering due to living in captivity. The video footage showed proof of how the whales attacked trainers and made me believe what the movie was trying to prove. By using interviews of former trainers I formed a sense of trust that what they were saying was completely true because they had experienced it first hand. I would recommend this movie to everyone that enjoys documentaries.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Biography,Documentary,News"}, "index_71": {"review_id": "rw0975639", "reviewer": "film-critic", "movie": "the bourne supremacy", "rating": "2", "review_summary": "I remember good things all the time.", "review_date": "10 December 2004", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "I must first say that I have not read this book, I am purely basing this review off the film that I just witnessed. When I watched the Bourne Identity, I was taken aback. While I didn't think that it was the best film out there, I did see potential and some very exciting location scenes. It was as if we were witnessing an American James Bond being Bourne (sorry, no more puns\u0085). This original film kept me on my seat and excited about the characters during the two hour run. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. It seemed, and felt, as if this was a harder book to put into a film. Perhaps it was the direction, or even the screenplay, but there was way too much happening in the short 109 minutes that this film ran. From inconsistent flashbacks to a feeling that you had to memorize the first film to get this one, I felt the Bourne Supremacy was like a spilled bucket of nails \u0085 bits and pieces were all over the place, and it hurt to pick them all up at once.Damon seemed to do well revisiting his character of Jason Bourne, a bit more stable than in the original, his combination of two facial expressions helped push me through the rest of this film. Brian Cox is Brian Cox, his characters seem to always be very similar in nature. He looks gruff, but does he always need to act gruff? Joan Allen felt as if she had something up her rumpus throughout the entire film. Her character had no emotion, no expression, and no excitement, which eventually was pushed off onto me. She ruined this film. I could not stand watching her on screen, I felt that she had no chemistry with the rest of the cast and that she was involved only to collect the much needed paycheck. Did anyone else feel as if you were watching another version of X-Men? Wolverine can't remember his past and the Brian Cox connection? I guess I let my mind wander too much through this film or maybe I just wanted to re-watch that film instead, but there was this eerie resemblance that hovered over my mind.So, we have sub-par actors trying to build some intensity and ultimately failing? What else could go wrong? Well, how about the shambled mess of plots known as the \"story\"? What was going on here. I felt as if I was being pulled in about a thousand different directions. I am a huge fan of the multi-layered stories, but only if they have some logical connection between them. There was no connection in this story. While director Greengrass attempted in every way possible to keep us in step with Bourne, you couldn't help but get lost. Literally, I felt as if I needed a road map when I rented this film. What does this tell you? Instead of the choppy, unsteady-cam flashback sequences, Greengrass should have spent a bit more time on some back-story or development. The drunken flashback moments just didn't work for me. I felt as if I could have understood this film a bit better by getting intoxicated myself, instead of allowing the director to do it for me. I was lost. It really felt as if they were grabbing at anything possible to connect this espionage thriller together. There was bad glue and I couldn't understand why nobody saw this.Actors being average (or below average) coupled with a broken, choppy story is no way to bring us a sequel. I guess if you wanted to build a better reputation on the original you would release a film like this. I should check the latest reports on how The Bourne Identity is doing in rental and sales to see if this is true. When you go into a sequel, you expect to see similar faces, bigger effects, and/or a deeper story. What instead occurred with The Bourne Supremacy were similar yet under-producing faces, no better effects (the car chase doesn't count since you can see that in nearly every other action/espionage film), and a story that ranks among the worst Hollywood has to offer. I am not sure how closely it is to Ludlum's story, but I have a feeling he may not be as happy with this endeavor. It was a brutal mutilation of his characters.Overall, I was not impressed. My wife didn't even make it through the film because it gave us both headaches. Damon can do Bourne well, but the material that he was handed to this film should have been reconsidered. Perhaps a new director would have worked to give a new image to the Bourne name and style. Either way, something needed to be done and it wasn't. This was a poor excuse for a sequel and a dark chapter in this seemingly exciting character's life. Skip it. I promise it will make you a better person.Grade: ** out of *****", "publish_date": "2004", "category": "Action,Mystery,Thriller"}, "index_72": {"review_id": "rw2990640", "reviewer": "ASouthernHorrorFan", "movie": "i, frankenstein", "rating": "5", "review_summary": "My Review Of \"I, Frankenstein\"", "review_date": "1 April 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "\"I, Frankenstein\" is a modern re-invention of one of literature's most fascinating characters, Frankenstein's Monster. A character that dominates the screen in almost every film that features him. \"I, Frankenstein\" manages to meld the monster creatively into a new saga based on an old world spiritual concept of good and evil and humanity and all that is right and balanced in the cosmos. Yea I know that last statement seems a bit much but the struggle of good and evil and maintaining balance has fueled culture since the beginning of civilization. I imagine one of the food sources was probably hallucinogenic and our concept of the world just echoed from that first moment of existentialism. Anyway back to the film \"I, Frankenstein\"...The story that Stuart Beattie and Kevin Grevioux give us is a standard saga that has planned out in many a film, television drama and game. The dark lord of infinite evil sets forth to consume all the world and bring back the age of chaos. The truth and light of the universe battle the evil to keep order and protect humanity. It is a great epic drama filled with plenty of action, passion and spectacle fit for a gamer. I just feel the story may be a bit \"monochrome\". \"I, Frankenstein\" works as an elaborate blast of high theatricals and it did justify my expense for a theatre quality sound system. The film just lacked feeling, and connectivity. I didn't feel the characters. Just as the Monster lacked a soul but still managed to be fueled by a passionate rage, \"I, Frankenstein\" was without soul. The difference is unlike the Monster, this film lacked the passionate fuel that the story demanded. It was like watching an intro to some video game story sequence. It was a really good story, creative and all. I just didn't find the depth of character that would make me connect with the film. The effects where what one would expect in this \"big popcorn\", wall rattling spectacle. The CGI was tight, I did feel that it was a bit too much. Like \"Van Helsing\", \"I, Frankenstein\" relied heavily on the CGI which stripped the film down to a \"basic\", going through the emotions action film. That sort of anchor creates a disconnect from the organic feeling, and natural flow of character interaction on a personal level that allows the audience to really connect with, not only the characters and story, but also the heart and intent of what the writer and directer are aiming for. \"I, Frankenstein\" is a 50/50 film for me. Yeah the movie brings the action and excitement.

Dangerous Lies was sadly a big mess, it had potential but slowly fell apart as the film went on, let's talk about this more in detail.Let's start off with a couple of positives, firstly the film's cinematography and set pieces were great, and they had a good set up of conflict at the beginning. The film's mise en scene was definitely very good, the house of Leonard (Elliot Gould) was beautiful and was so big, it was the perfect place to hide multiple secrets throughout the movie, I also thought they set up the conflict between Katie (Camila Mendes) and Adam (Jesse T Usher) very well at the beginning. When Adam saved Katie from her restaurant being robbed it set up the conflict well when it fast forwarded to their current relationship when they were arguing about job's because she didn't go back to the restaurant and about Adam risking his life, so this set up the tone well between both of the characters, it wasn't consistent but it was good while it lasted.Now let's get into my first two negatives, the film had a lack of character background with a poor meeting of the characters and a tonal imbalance of the conflict between the two main characters. The film set up the introduction of Kate and Adam like they had never seen each other and then they suddenly cut to them kissing, this was very odd for me and caught me off guard showing the poor execution, especially if they are going to be the main characters of the movie, and we also knew practically nothing about the characters which was not great when you are supposed to connect to them fairly quickly, they also had a lot of tonal issues in terms of the conflict between Kate and Adam, one minute they were in love with one another next they were at each other's throats, this changed multiple time every half an hour and really just switched me off from both of the characters.My next two negatives would be the film's lazy attempts at emotion and the lapses in the logic with some of the questionable decisions. The film did an absolutely pathetic job at trying to cause emotion which really didn't work at all. How they executed Leonard's death was extremely fast the characters showed hardly any emotion and there was no build up whatsoever. Kate and Adam just went through the house and saw him sitting dead on a chair and that was it, it just didn't feel important or well earned, and there was so many lapses in the logic Kate and Adam just sat there talking about Leonard and the money they found for what felt like forever as he was just sitting dead in the background, they didn't call an ambulance for such a long time it just felt ridiculous and there was multiple decisions made by both the main characters that made no sense and just really made the film look unprofessional.My next two positives would be the film's mysterious tone and the chemistry between the characters was good. The film did manage to execute a good mysterious tone as more secrets were revealed about who the killer would be, and I was constantly questioning who the murderer was so the movie had that going for it. The chemistry between the characters was also good. The actual acting performances were just average, but Kate and Adam had good chemistry when they were getting along and their relationship was believable as well as the relationship between Kate and Leonard.My next two negatives would be my lack of connection to the main characters and the film being unsure on what character to root for. I just didn't really like the main characters hardly at all, they made so many questionable decisions about the money that they found showing a lack of something to connect with because any good person would of handed it in but they kept the money for most of the movie. And due to the film having everyone being a suspect they really made it unclear of what characters to root for, they built up Adam to look suspicious with multiple things and then he was fine, they did the same thing with Kate, making it really unclear who the good guy was so this was a big switch off for me.My final two positives would be that the film had some clever plot choices and plot twists. I thought that when they weren't going crazy with the plot twists and they kept the narrative fairly consistent some of the twists worked involving why the house was given to Kate and who was trying to break into the house, and some of the plot choices building up to who was the villain and what was truly going on were clever before it got messy, but they definitely had moments of cleverness with the plots sprinkled through the movie It's just a shame it wasn't consistent throughout.My final two negatives that sadly put the nail in the coffin for the movie for me was the overcomplicated plot especially the final act and the messy ending. They were doing really well with the plot but as soon as they got into the final act they started to add way to many plot twists really making the movie lose it's focus and due to there being so many reveals it left to many unanswered questions that could of easily been limited to a couple of reveals to make it easier on the movie. The ending was also just messy, there was to many bad guys, it was rushed, and I lost interest fairly quickly as it got more and more ridiculous and messy leaving me not very impressed at how the movie ended up.Overall Dangerous lies had potential with some of its plot choices and characters, but fell apart more and more as the film went on, leading to a messy and unfocused movie that felt to amateurish.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Drama,Mystery,Thriller"}, "index_74": {"review_id": "rw5585543", "reviewer": "rnixon-15663", "movie": "dark waters", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "Dark Waters", "review_date": "28 March 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Dark waters\n2020\n12A\nDirector: Todd Haynes\nStarring: Mark Ruffalo, Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pullman, Bill Camp, Victor Garber etcOverall rating 72/100Dark waters is based on the true events of the mass water pollution caused by the chemical company Dupont. Corporate defence attorney Rob Billot (Mark Ruffalo) must fight for the people of America who are having their water poisoned everyday. Dark waters was good and got its message across well, but for me was a slight down, and for me could have been structured much better. So lets talk about this more in detail.First of all the film had great cinematography and managed to execute a uncomfortable tone fairly well. The film surprised me at how beautiful its visuals was, it had stunning views of the city landscape, it had some really interesting close up shots in particular in the office with the multiple blinds, and largely the movie was just beautiful to watch with many interesting set locations as well. Also the film managed to execute a uncomfortable tone pretty well, when it did actually go into detail about the effect of the water being polluted the film did an excellent job at making the audience know just how bad the c8 was. They largely managed to execute this well with the use of graphic and disturbing imagery that really stuck with you when watching.Next I thought the film had a lot of pacing inconsistencies and I had a lack of connection to the emotion and conflict. For me the films pacing was just all over the place. There was parts that were really slow when and my interest was sadly not there throughout the movie consistently, but also I felt like they rushed some important parts of the movie as well, conversations between important people and what was supposed to be key emotional moments lasted a few seconds and then they moved on causing a disconnect emotionally for me in places. This is largely due to the fact that I think they stuffed to much plot into the movie and it didn't completely work. And the attempted conflict between the family just felt tacked on for me and they tried to add more to it, but for me this steered away from what should have been the main focus of the movie which was the poison in the water killing people and turning more into a melodramatic family drama towards the end which was a shame.Next I thought that there was likeable lead characters with great chemistry and the performances from Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway were fantastic. Both the characters of Rob Billet and Sarah Bilott were incredibly likeable throughout. You couldn't help but respect Rob for his passion at wanting to protect the people that were being harmed and the lengths he was willing to go in order for him to achieve this so this was well done. And Sarah was also very likeable, as due to the social context of the time still being fairly sexist, Sarah rose above the men that took advantage of her or didn't pay he attention and stuck with her husband and stood her ground in a fairly male dominated film. They also had great chemistry as husband and wife as well, with their relationship feeling organic and believable with its up and downs throughout. And the performances from both Mark and Anne were fantastic, with both putting on believable and passionate performances that really made you connect with their characters.My next two positives would the films good character development and its excellent themes on power. The films character development with Mark Ruffalo's character was excellent. He was so passionate and so willing to do whatever it took to prove he was right was executed excellently. Whatever push back e received he always came back with something bigger and better truly making you believe in his character. Also, the films theme on power was excellent and eye opening. The film tackled some big issues with the company Dupont, and the fact that this was a movie based off real events and a real company was scary. And the fact that they were so willing to put the blame on others or cover up their tracks in any way possible was a big reflection of the power system of today and other powerful companies and people.However my final two negatives that made dark waters a bit disappointing for me would be that there was to many characters with a lack of depth and development and I felt like they actually played it fairly safe with the films conflict and main issue of water pollution. The film just had to many characters that were just in the film for the sake of being there. It just made it slightly difficult to connect with the movie as there was so many characters that I just simply didn't care about so I thought this was a shame and could have been condensed to a certain amount of characters. And finally I actually thought the movie played it safe with its conflict and issues. For me it felt like they were holding back In showing the true effects of what the poisoning does to people beyond just being told which I thought was a shame and instead for me they decided to rely more on melodramatic and generic family drama as the film went on which I found really frustrating as they had the foundations of a great message to spread and it was well executed in places but it fell flat and the focus was taken to much of it at the ending for me.Overall dark waters, has excellent character development, likeable characters and is visually striking, and has two excellent performances from both Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway and manages to execute its message occassionly. But sadly is held back by its overstuffed plot and characters. Pacing issues and losing its main message by sadly playing it safe and going for a more family drama leading me to be slightly disappointed by the end result.", "publish_date": "2019", "category": "Biography,Drama,History"}, "index_75": {"review_id": "rw3438661", "reviewer": "jdcraw", "movie": "batman v superman: dawn of justice", "rating": "5", "review_summary": "Great To Look At, Not Much Under The Surface", "review_date": "25 March 2016", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "I will start this by stating this is not a bad movie.For me, this personally lacked character development and substantiation to really get me involved in the film. I really did enjoy how Batman vs. Superman DOJ connected the destruction of Metropolis in the final scenes of Man of Steel to this film. Taking this into account helps to establish Bruce Wayne's (Ben Affleck's) view point of how Superman (Henry Cavill) could be viewed as a force of power that, without some form of restriction, would ultimately continue to lead to destruction and chaos. The opening scenes of DOJ, depicting Batman's tragic origins and Bruce Wayne's heroic attempt at rescuing Wayne Enterprises' employees from the ensuing destruction that is brought by Zod and Superman, are meant to establish the emotional importance and driving force of Bruce Wayne's motives throughout this film. The last lingering word's of Bruce's father, \"Martha\", again are meant to resonate throughout the film for Bruce.Sadly, they do not. This all gets lost when we are quickly transported to the desert in a situation that's hard to decipher and fully understand until about 2/3 of the way through the film. This is a scene that having a full understanding of is crucial to the development of the DOJ story. After this we are sped over to Bruce and Alfred (Jeremy Irons). These two really lacked any kind of connection, and I did not believe for once that the fatherly and mentor bond that should exist between Alfred and Bruce was ever present. Bruce spends most of his portion of the film nonchalantly floating through his dialogue without any sense of urgency or purpose that is driving him. This is the case for Superman as well as he reaches to find the deep emotional connection to his feelings associated with the struggle of being Superman and dealing with the aftermath he leaves in his wake. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) does do any excellent job in her supportive role as she attempts to console Superman and help him realize that, in spite of unintended consequences, he is ultimately a force for good. It's just hard to believe that Superman (Cavill) ever actually felt a deep internal struggle to begin with.Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) was just over-the-top in his forced performance of portraying a character meant to be mentally disturbed with idiosyncrasies that are reminiscent of how many of us acted for weeks after watching Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight.Overall, the cinematography was excellent and action was very well done.

Basically upper middle class suburban Chicago family the Jarretts are trying to return to normal life following the death of teenage son Jordan 'Buck'(Scott Doebler) in a boating accident, and shortly after this his brother Conrad (Oscar and twice Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Timothy Hutton) attempted to commit suicide and spent four months in an psychiatric hospital. Conrad has returned to high school and senior year, he tries partaking in activities such as swimming and choir, but feeling alienated by lively but awkward father Calvin (Golden Globe nominated Donald Sutherland) and denying and secretly cold mother Beth (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Mary Tyler Moore) he restarts psychiatric therapy outside the hospital with Dr. Tyrone Berger (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Judd Hirsch). Calvin tries a few attempts to connect with his surviving son, while Beth tries to stay composed in order to maintain perfection and normality for the family, and Conrad, going through unorthodox session with Dr. Berger still finds difficulty communicating with his parents, but he starts dating fellow student Jeannine Pratt (Elizabeth McGovern) who gives him optimism. Conrad and mother Beth often argue, and Calvin in the heat of the moment often takes sides with his son, but discovering his after school psychiatric session an argument becomes very heated, and later taking a trip to Houston an argument ignites between Beth and Calvin, he has a rage, and she explains feeling repressed. Conrad has a breakdown when he finds out fellow psychiatric hospital friend Karen Aldrich (Dinah Manoff) has committed suicide, but a breakthrough session with Dr. Berger helps him to stop blaming himself for the death of Buck, as he was there with him, and in the end Beth leaves home following a last emotional talk with her husband, so Calvin and Conrad cope with their new situation and try to connect at last.

Tyler Moore gives a great performance as the elegant woman socialising and putting on a smile but is actually suffering within, Sutherland is interesting as the father who is cheerful but perhaps equally stressed, Hutton is deserving of his accolade being the distressed teenager trying to feel loved and make sense of where he is going in life, and Hirsch is likable as the psychiatric doctor with unusual methods to get into the mindset of his patient and bring out true feelings. When I know films like The Elephant Man and Raging Bull were released the same year during Oscar season, I question the wins for Best Picture and Best Director, but I can understand why they went to this film, it is scripted well and has the right level of emotion and poignancy to tell a story based on therapy and life following tragedy, a most watchable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay.

I can't help it. It's my favorite of the year thus far although admittedly there are still a number of films I have yet to see.Darren Aronofsky bounces back from his most recent and under appreciated fantasy film, \"The Fountain\" with his smooth and compelling Direction in \"The Wrestler.\" Not the avant-garde style we've grown accustomed to with Aronofsky but he knocks it out of the park with the characters emotional prowess and his ability to make you deeply connect with them. The story, written by Robert Siegel, who previous to this has only one credit to his name, is a captivating and brutally honest story about a man coping with life when the only thing he has and has ever known is taken away from him leaving him alone with nothing but a search for who he is.The arc of this film is flawless and it starts with an adrenaline pumping rendition of 80's metal band Quiet Riot's \"Bang Your Head\" blasting over a slow moving collage of fliers, posters, pictures and event tickets depicting the glory days of wrestling star Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson played by the talented but much maligned Mickey Rourke. You need not look any further than the lyrics of this song to find out who \"The Ram\" is. There's a love-fest with the 80's in that there are parallels the film has with 80's heavy metal music and the WWF during that time with Hulk Hogan and the Iron Sheik being part of pop culture, as it was in the early years here between \"The Ram\" and his adversary \"The Ayotolla\". The music is great and every time you hear an 80's song you get goosebumps... or is that just me? The films closing credits are no other than Bruce \"The Boss\" Springsteen with his gruff voice and Oscar buzzing song titled, go figure, \"The Wrestler\". Everything in between those two songs is a clinic on film making and a beautifully well made piece of art, taking you out of the glamor and limelight wrestling stars can obtain but into the behind the scenes world where you must face the repercussions of the physical abuse taken by nature of the sport as well as the lonely empty feeling of the audacious lifestyle.Mickey Rourke in a career reviving role plays \"The Ram\" magnificently as a physically beaten up hanger-on wrestling star in the twilight of his career. Due to health concerns he's forced to retire and begins thinking about life after wrestling. Outside of his career, his only source of companionship's comes from the neighborhood kids, that actually seem to have enough sense to recognize \"The Ram's\" state of loneliness and a stripper that he's befriended at the local Strip Club that goes by the stage name Cassidy played rock solidly by a gorgeous Marisa Tomei. Tomei's fearless performance is so strong I would actually consider it to be her finest work to date, which is clearly a mouthful considering she won an Academy Award for her work in 'My Cousin Vinny\". She brings such a human element to a profession that you wouldn't likely find yourself rooting for, frankly, and she pulls off the challenging feat by leaving you actually feeling compassion and sadness for her. Incidentally, she looks amazing in this and let me just say there is plenty of her to see. Wow! It's clear there is a connection between Cassidy and \"The Ram\" that runs deeper than a typical customer-client relationship and when \"The Ram\" tells her of his retirement plans and hopes to take their relationship to the next level she suggests that he get in touch with his estranged teenage daughter whom he hardly knows after walking out on her while she was very young. The uber-talented Evan Rachel Wood continues her rise to super stardom with another poignantly strong performance as a teenage girl that wants her father back yet clearly deeply hurt but the damage that has already been done. When these worlds collide it's just beautiful cinema between two characters and I can see their scenes together being widely used in acting classes abroad. They should be anyway.It's to often stated that a specific actor was \"born to play the role\" when a career defining piece of work vaults them into critical acclaim and a legitimate Oscar contender, which I will be shocked and extremely disappointed if Rourke isn't recognized with a nomination here, but in this case it is warranted. Rourke doesn't play \"The Ram\", Rourke IS \"The Ram\". This is what they mean when they say \"art imitating life.\" I couldn't help but get the feeling that I was watching the internal struggles brought on by the reckless lifestyle of actor Mickey Rourke rather than that of Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson even though they are very much one in the same. The movie will stick with you and it's performances are eerie and haunting in a way that you want more, you miss them. You cannot help but acquire feelings for these characters on some level and there are many to subconsciously choose from. You name the emotion, and it is somewhere in the dynamics between the leads.

I mean, Gal is Jewish, and that is problematic. And WW is in a heteronormative loving relationship with a Ciss white male and that is problematic too. And, Wiig is a woman AND a bad guy and that is problematic, right? I mean, all of that is super problematic because it caters to the far right... right? So I'm supposed to hate it because of that, right?No, no, no, no, because the other bad guy, he maybe slightly resembles Trump, so that makes it OK to like it because it might be making commentary about Trump and Orange Man Bad and... I'm so confused.What I want to say is that I have read conflicting critic's opinions on this and I don't know which is the right think way to review it!!!!!You know what, I THINK IT'S BEST THAT WE TOTALLY IGNORE THE POLITICS AND JUST REVIEW THE MOVIE AS A MOVIE:Well.... it's too long. I mean I liked the film, but there was too much not story in it that could have, and needed to be trimmed... or at least replaced with MORE story.And then the Fx.... they were CLEARLY going for an 80s super hero movie ala Supergirl feel, every now and again and, as where it is clear as day that they are doing that... it's 2020 and from reading the NON political reviews it is clear that people don't get that.... because everything is literal and homages that do NOT mock the past tend to go over people's heads.... because.... our collective IQs have dropped to 90.So it's something I liked, but I can see where people are complaining about it.Gadot, well, she made a huge sacrifice in this, she got everything she wanted and had to give it away, and there are times in this where you really feel that lose... and kudos to that. But... you sort of feel that the emotion should have been carried further and that not doing so was a bit of a lost opportunity, in the most dramatic sense.But there is still a lot more of an emotional connection to WW in this, and that is a pretty big step above the first film. I feel like I related to her a little more in this, she was more human and less goddess, and that is welcomed.The opening was a little too much \"We've seen this before\" and the surprise at the end was a little too much \"we saw this coming,\" but still welcomed even if the clue dropped half-way through made it an obvious guess.Over all, it was a lot better and had more depth than the first outing, and was able to add 80s cheese without falling into the \"we are going to mock the decade for being in the past,\" trope that so many other shows and movies have fallen into.I don't get the non political 1 star reviews, it has it's faults, but not as many as they are making out.

This is a poster child for a studio using a recognizable name to hit a release date. They were going to release this in July of 2001 no matter what, and they rushed everything along. It's possible to deliver a good movie with a constantly changing script like The Great Escape, but it's more of a recipe for a mess. Tim Burton was not given any time to figure out his vision for the film, and he just filmed, at breakneck speed, a script that didn't know what it was or what it was about.Captain Leo Davidson is a pilot on a space station orbiting Saturn who's in charge of ape pilots. When an unusual electro-magnetic storm sweeps by, they send in an ape who promptly gets lost, and then Davidson jumps into a pod without orders to try and find him. He gets hit by stuff and crash lands in a forest on a new planet. Before he can settle, he's swept up in a chase of apes looking to round up humans. By the time Davidson is in a cage, being carted off to Ape City, a grand twenty minutes have passed in the film, and that's the greatest source of the movie's problems. It just simply moves too quickly, covering everything too shallowly, and more concerned with visual spectacle than actual storytelling.On the space station, we get introduced to two humans beyond Davidson, and neither of them matter once he's off the station. On the planet, we get views of about half a dozen humans who are going to tag along with Davidson through the end of the film and they never make any sort of impression. The apes do a better job, though. There's Thade, an ape general and the chief protagonist, and Ari, the human rights loving daughter of a senator. The thing is that this movie feels like their story, but they don't get introduced until the half hour point and they are very much not the focus. Davidson never gets any sort of emotional connection to anything on this planet, insisting on just getting off as soon as possible. So, our main character is a vessel obsessed with a single object and refuses any emotional attachments, while two of our supporting characters have the actual emotional support but are so far pushed into the background that every moment feels like it comes out of nowhere.Davidson escapes, brings along his human companions and Ari, picks up the slave trader, Limbo, who had bought the humans from the military (whose only purpose seems to be picking up humans in forests), and they walk into the Forbidden Area. Meanwhile, Thade visits his father in the one scene that probably exemplifies everything wrong with this movie in microcosm.So, Thade's father is played by Charlton Heston, proving that he's a great actor even under fantastic ape makeup. In this scene, we get introduced to a character who's never been seen before and gets discarded by the end, an object of great value we've never seen before and gets destroyed by the end in what's supposed to be a great dramatic moment, and callbacks to the original movie that end up falling flat. There's no setup to anything that happens in this scene. It all just happens in quick succession, and none of it impacts with any emotion. It's a dead scene that's supposed to be full of meaning and winks to the audience that end up working against it. Much like the rest of the movie.The thing about callbacks is that they are jokey by nature. It's hard to make a callback of something extremely well known work dramatically because we all have the, \"I know that reference,\" reaction that undermines the dramatic import of the moment. So, when Attar looks down at Davidson and says, \"Take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human,\" the audience is chuckling instead of feeling any kind of fear. When Charlton Heston says, \"Damn them...damn them all to hell!\" we have the same kind of guffaw instead of any other emotion at the death of a character, who we haven't seen before this very scene.I'm not sure when it became de rigueur for pretty much every action/adventure movie of a certain budget to end with a battle scene against two armies, but Planet of the Apes is one of the most ridiculous of them. An army showing up out of nowhere in the minutes before the battle, flying apes with super jump abilities, and the death of side characters with dramatic feel that fall flat is how this whole thing works out. It's bizarre and it betrays the fact that no one understood where the dramatic core of this movie was.There are no ideas at play in this film. It's just a bunch of people running around for two hours without ever giving the audience any time to think about any ideas or characters or even setting.I've avoided talking about the original because this re-imagining of the idea works so poorly on its own that there's really no need for comparison, but I do think that a comparison is justified in order to help explain why the 2001 version fails so badly. Just look at the first half hour of each of them. In the original, we get a very clear idea of who our main character, Taylor, is and what he believes. We get a steady build on the setting of this new world that comes to a shock at the sight of apes riding horses. In the re-imagining, we have a bevy of characters running around talking in inanities that don't matter, special effects, and then an action scene without ever getting to know anything about our main character, Davidson, other than that he loves his ape and wants to get it back. It's thin at its absolute best, and that's not very good.This was Tim Burton's lowest point, but because of studio pressure on the production timeline, it could be excused to a certain extent. However, he went on to make Alice in Wonderland, so we all know that he had further depths to explore. This is a prime example of how not to reboot a moribund franchise. But, the ape makeup is absolutely fantastic, the movie looks pretty good most of the time, and this might be my favorite Danny Elfman score.

It's centered around a small cast of unique characters, a mostly singular location and an emotionally moving story; it's themes of injustice, inevitability, benevolence and miracles raise it above the typical 'prison film' fare - making it something that's actually rather poignant. It's different to what I expected it to be, telling a small-scale story with some unexpected supernatural elements, and is pretty emotionally powerful throughout. It is actually fairly compassionate, with the prison guards being portrayed as kind and gentle for the most part. There isn't an emphasis on brutality or malevolence, and each of the inmates is made to be sympathetic. It is often compared to 'The Shawshank Redemption', for it's setting and key crew - as well as a very similar score by Thomas Newman. While I do prefer 'Shawshank' - a film which is on the top end of my ten favourite films of all time - I certainly appreciate this as well, and honestly feel that it is a very different experience.The script is excellent, proving that Darabont knows how to write. I'm not sure how much of the dialogue is lifted directly from the novel, but the film creates a plethora of rounded and relatable characters that hold the film together. It's as much a character study as it is a larger story, but both elements are handled spectacularly. Each character feels like a real person, with motivations and desires as well as specific personalities; every decision they make fits them perfectly, and there are no sudden changes of heart just for the sake of the film. The characters are brought to life with amazing performances from every cast member - especially Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse and Michael Jeter. Special mention needs to be made for Sam Rockwell, who stars in a fairly major role that isn't mentioned much. It further solidifies him as an excellent actor, and he is giving 100% to this role; he is incredibly ferocious, energetic and downright despicable. His character, along with Doug Hutchinson's sadistic prison guard, is perhaps the closest thing the film has to a villain - which may be it's most conventional aspect. All of the characters are compelling and given just the right amount of screen-time. The general story is, as I mentioned, small in scale and most of the film is confined to a single prison 'block'. This actually helps the picture greatly, as it allows it to focus on the people and events that are important to the narrative.The film is a very long one, clocking in at just over three hours, but it kept my attention throughout; I can honestly say that the time flew by, and that the film didn't feel over-long at all. I can't think of a single scene that should have been cut. Perhaps there are a couple that could have, but every scene serves a purpose - whether to advance the plot, develop the characters or even just to provide a little humour. Speaking of which, the picture does feature some light-hearted and funny elements sprinkled throughout. I actually thought that it's tone worked perfectly, and the humour never felt cringe-inducing or out of place; it fit into the story really well, helping to balance out some of the emotionally heavier scenes. The movie does have it's fare share of those too. Scenes featuring Michael Clark Duncan's character in particular were very moving, and his performance is very strong. He has a few short monologues that solidify the themes of the film without shoving them down your throat, which are thought-provoking and wistful. An ending piece of narration also feels remarkably poignant and really makes you think. The film does a very good job of balancing the heavy with the light, effortlessly playing with several emotions at once, so much so that one scene had me practically hiding behind my hands - because the events within it were horrific for a certain sympathetic character - and then another shortly after had me smiling at the connection between a man and a mouse. It not only makes you sad but also happy, a rare combination; it's touching, somber, funny, heartbreaking and entertaining. Overall, 'The Green Mile' is an excellent movie with an impactful story, compassionate outlook and believable characters; it is incredibly well directed, acted and written. Not only is it compelling and provides entertainment throughout it's long run-time, it's emotionally stirring and generally moving. One of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one which really got to me internally, I'd recommend that everyone take the time to watch this: 8/10", "publish_date": "1999", "category": "Crime,Drama,Fantasy"}, "index_81": {"review_id": "rw3498327", "reviewer": "cekadah", "movie": "me before you", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "A nice little 3 hanky tear jerker with a very abominable message", "review_date": "3 July 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "If the director of a movie has stirred an emotion in a viewer does that make it a good movie? I think 'yes' because the viewer has been touched within and the story connected with that person, on some level. Unfortunately for Director: Thea Sharrock and Writer: Jojo Moyes the emotional connection for this viewer (me) was negative and borderline angry. But the movie is a good 6 or 7 stars worth to me because I found it well scripted, acted and photographed.The plot is so British class oriented I was gritting my teeth. We have Will Traynor an upper crust society rich boy who is able to afford any indulgence he so desires. He lives in a mansion and owns an ancestral castle. Has had top line education and was a multi-talented sportsman and is exceptionally handsome. Mr upper crust Will is arrogant, self centered, and oh so superior. Then there is Lou Clark a working class former shop girl living in a small bungalow with her family. Her father is currently unemployed and cannot find a job. The family depends on Lou's income to make ends meet. She looses her shop job and applies as a companion aide to the now disabled (quadriplegic) Will Traynor. His mother is so charmed by Miss shop girl Lou's cheerful and quirky attitude she hires her. So there's the first problem - a working class person having to survive by being 'in service' to an upper society family. What a good little Brit she is! And of course the Traynor's feel it's their duty to provide for the lower classes so they hire Lou's father as a 'castle facility technician' - read 'grounds keeper for the castle'! Then there is the ever available Nathan who supplies the muscle to move Will from bed to chair and back, plus keep account of Will's borderline health. It's never explained how Nathan is always - on call! Can't keep the 'superiors of society' waiting!The title \"Me Before You\" is also an issue with this viewer! We are never given a definition of this title. Which of the two main characters is 'Me' and which is 'You'! Think about it ... as the relationship between Will & Lou warms up the easy answer is Will as the 'Me' because of his death wish and to hell with the now close emotional bond between Will & Lou. (by-the-way if Will so wanted to die why didn't he give in to his lung infection when hospitalized? It surely would have easily killed a quadriplegic)On the other hand it's not too difficult to take Lou as the 'Me' because she has dedicated her efforts to 'change Will' and bring him out of his self imposed reclusiveness and bitterness toward life. Lou is determined to make him change his mind on being euthanized. So there's the conflict - neither one actually respects the emotional bond & love that has developed between them. Will hates his physical existence and wants death as a release. Lou can only focus on how happy she is being with him. Both are not thinking about how the other one feels.My other problem with this story is very simple to grasp. Will has everything a person could want and the intelligence to create a new life for himself but chooses death because he cannot live as he did before his disability. The producers of this story are implying a disabled person is less of a human due to a disability, is permanently unhappy, and not capable of contributing to society thus death is their best option! If Will was fine physically but emotionally depressed and wanted to be euthanized would the viewing public be as enthusiastic about this movie? Definitely not!The subconscious messages in this story are shameful but go completely unnoticed because they are wrapped up and hidden in a sweet & tearful tragic love story.", "publish_date": "2016", "category": "Drama,Romance"}, "index_82": {"review_id": "rw5728773", "reviewer": "ethanj-41027", "movie": "the social network", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "21st Century Gold", "review_date": "11 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "The Social Network (2010) - [8/10]I am really close to review this as a 9/10. The Social Network (2010) is a fantastic film. I am a huge fan of David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin, and this film fuels the admiration I have for them. Fincher directs masterfully in this horrific biopic, coupled with Sorkin's elegant dialogue. Without Sorkin, the film wouldn't work. Without Fincher, the film wouldn't work. Two masters work together to create an amazing film. I really would like to give this film a higher rating, but there are a couple things holding me back. In my opinion, it lacks something spectacular. Whether that be from the emotional detachment of the main character(s) or the fact that some scenes feel unneeded, I think it misses something that could have made it perfect. One scene in particular was very strange. It involves a CG, but not CG, effect during a boat race. When I look back on this scene, in terms of the rest of the story, it's really out of place (the music choice is also quite strange). Thinking about it more, it's still very important for multiple reasons. So it feels out of place, yet deeply important... very conflicting ideas. Another issue I had, and it's actually part of why I like the film, is the pacing. For the most part, The Social Network (2010) is extremely fast paced. Dialogue races by with each shot. There are scenes that are short, but sweet with excellent cutting. But, because it is so fast (and complex), you can get lost in what is happening. Some of the most important scenes happen very fast and it's hard to digest, analyze, and remember everything. This is also a positive for The Social Network (2010). The fact that you need to watch it multiple times to pick up on every little complexity is genius (Sorkin is a master in that way). This was the fourth time I watched the film and, don't get me wrong, I really love it. I think it's one of the best biographical films that has been made, and its message is just as powerful - if not more powerful, today. The acting is exceptional (especially from our leads, Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield) but, there is quite a big emotional disconnect between this film and the audience (at least for me anyways). This is a result from our lead character, Mark Zuckerberg - played by Jesse Eisenberg, who just isn't likable. In fact, he is the villain of this story (rather one of them). For the most part we're against him, morally and legally. The only likable character is Eduardo Saverin - played by Andrew Garfield but, he is the supporting character (I could actually make an argument that he is the main character of the story and very well should be, but I digress). I think because of the choice to have only one hero, who is a supporting character, this film loses all the emotion it could have generated. The moments where Garfield stands in the spotlight are highly emotional, and I applaud his performance. It was really rewarding to see Garfield's talent when a great director utilizes it. I've always believed that he is one of the most underrated actors of this generation and if more directors see his potential, he could be one of the greats (similar to Adam Driver). Eisenberg is excellent in this film. He perfectly portrays an unapologetic, selfish jerk - alongside Justin Timberlake. Eisenberg is emotionless, and fits Zuckerberg's character perfectly. He is extremely detached from humanity and human emotion, yet he makes founds social media phenomenon that strives for human connection. It is so compelling, and Eisenberg makes it so. The cinematography of this film is stark, detached, and formulaic - just like it should be. The editing is fast paced, but sacrifices slow, emotional moments for orchestral dialogue. The writing is exceptional (and one of the reasons I want this film to be a 9/10). This film features one of the greatest scripts that was ever made. David Fincher directs with meaning, mastery, and minimalism. In the end, I really think the biggest problem this film faces is emotion. It tries desperately to conjure emotions (albeit it is able to conjure negative ones very easily), as seen with the very last scene of the film, but fails to do so in the long run. The Social Network (2010) is one of the greatest films released in the 21st century and is a must see for anybody that has ever heard the name, Facebook.", "publish_date": "2010", "category": "Biography,Drama"}, "index_83": {"review_id": "rw6306499", "reviewer": "rnixon-15663", "movie": "jingle jangle: a christmas journey", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Jingle jangle a christmas Journey", "review_date": "24 November 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Jingle Jangle a Christmas journey\nPG\nDirector: David E Talbert\nStarring: Forest Whitaker, Keegan Michael Key, Hugh Bonneville, Anika Noni Rose, Madalen Mills, Phylicia Rashad, Ricky Martin, justin cornwell, Sharon Rose, Lisa Davina Phillip, Kieron L Dyer, Miles Barrow, Diaana Babnicova etcOverall rating 95/100Jingle jangle a Christmas journey is about an imaginary world that comes to life in a holiday tale about an eccentric toymaker, his adventurous granddaughter, and a magic invention that has the power to change their lives forever. Wow what an absolutely amazing and delightful holiday movie Jingle Jangle Christmas was, there are so many good things to say about this so lets get started.First of all the cinematography was fantastic, the movie had a charming tone, great soundtrack and a unique narrative/ point of view. This movie looked absolutely fantastic, the movies visual creativity and world building was truly fantastic, it just felt like Christmas in one amazing visual explosion of colour amazing set locations and creativity for the story world. The movie also had a very charming tone, every single component of the movie was charming and made you feel all warm inside just like a good Christmas movie should do, this charm never went away and in fact just got better and better as the movie went along. The soundtrack was also fantastic, there was some very catchy and easy to listen to songs that just put a huge smile on my face, and the vocal talent involved was excellent. I Also loved the films unique narrative and viewpoint, telling the story from the perspective of 2 kids and their grandma was really interesting and tied together with the films themes, it also made the film feel like one massive story book which I absolutely loved as well, also adding to the movies visual creativity.I also loved the movies representation, likeable characters, performances and chemistry between characters. This movies racial representation was absolutely excellent, I loved that the majority of the cast was ethnically diverse, it made a refreshing change for a holiday movie and worked excellently. The movie also had incredibly likeable and loveable characters that were very easy to connect with, The granddaughter played by Madalen Mills had heaps of charm and the way she changed Jeronicuses (Forest Whitaker) life and bought the light and happiness back for him was just excellent. The chemistry between them both was also excellent, all the relationships within the movie felt very real and authentic and handled with great emotion and sensitivity. The performances themselves were also very good, and believable adding to the emotion of the movie which I will talk about soon.My only slight negative for the movie would be that it was slightly generic in places. The movie had slightly generic dialogue and characters that has been seen in previous holiday movies especially with the villain being someone supposedly cast aside and getting popularity for themselves.My next few positives would be the character background, set up with the villain and interesting toy creations. I loved the attention to detail and character background for Jeronicus, seeing him happy when he was younger and establishing and developing his relationship between his daughter was excellently done, it didn't feel rushed and established the desired tone and themes and established the characters well,. I also did like the set up with the villain, him being set aside from Jeronicus and his ideas and creations set the villains intentions out well and this transitioned well into the main plot of the movie with an excellent and campy performance from Keegan Michael Key who did a fantastic job. The toy creations were also really creative and were visually striking.My final few positives would be the deep themes, emotional weight and heart-warming ending. The movie actually had a lot of deep themes that was handled very well, how the movie tackled the process of grief and how that effects the relationships within family was very emotional and made the film have a surprising amount of depth, this added to the emotional weight of the movie a lot, the movie which was helped by its performances was genuinely emotional, in its handling of the relationship between Jeronicus and his daughter and will get to a lot of people. The ending was also extremely heart-warming, the movie had very satisfying endings for all of the character arcs and ended the movie perfectly.Overall, Jingle Jangle Christmas is a fantastic holiday movie, with fantastic performances, a great soundtrack, with heaps of charm and is a Christmas classic that I will be revisiting.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Family,Fantasy,Musical"}, "index_84": {"review_id": "rw5929307", "reviewer": "eleksa23", "movie": "adoration", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Stunning and thought provoking", "review_date": "24 July 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "I watched this movie last night, after being drawn to it by the unconventional plot that promised an emotionally intense story. Frankly, after waking up this morning I could not stop thinking about it, so I come here to pour out my thoughts. (Warning for ending spoilers in the last paragraph.)As everyone visiting this page can find out already, the movie tells about two women who are best friends since they were children. They are so close that the husband of one of them feels left out, and others doubt how platonic their bond really is. They start a relationship with each other's 20-year-old sons, which deeply affects their future life and emotional world.If you really think about it, you will notice how \"Adore\" quietly plays with the concepts of borders, limits, taboos and the idea of right or wrong. The movie wasted no time building up the relationships. Yes, we had some stares, some physical contact, but the wave of romantic emotions was quite sudden and did not have much explanation. The viewers had to see it with their own eyes and understand themselves. Like this Robin Wright and Xavier Samuel perfectly portray their characters' feelings in the very first intimate scene they have. The kisses following Ian's sudden first move show his desperation, longing, need, while Roz is surprised, reluctant but eventually gives in and responds the same way. Their relationship was never explained in words minus that first \"I love her\", but in my eyes this scene showed the perfect description of their whole relationship and dynamic.Meanwhile the start for Tom and Lil was completely different. She had been alone for years since her husband died. Tom went to her to spite his mother and best friend for what they had done, however, the long time Lil had spent alone is what I think helped it escalate.Unlike Ian and Roz, whose relationship had real romantic feelings, which began as him loving her and eventually became mutual, I find that Tom and Lil were connected mainly because of lust, some type of addiction, as well as Lil's need to feel young, loved, wanted and.... happy. Happiness was the reason and goal that was searched for by all four main characters. It was their pretext to continue pursuing their relationships despite the supposed social taboo -- though no real crime was ever made. Both of the young men were 20 when the relationships started, they were the initiators, and there was no real incest happening.And that is exactly where you understand how much the writers played with the concept of boundaries. How far is too far? How serious is too serious? What is true love, what is a normal love life, who are you allowed to love, and what does one do if all of these answers go against what they are feeling? You just need to realize how as a viewer you never really feel bad for Harold who was secretly cheated on by Roz, yet you feel for Lil and Roz when they see their boys pursue relationships with other women -- that is when you see how smartly the plot is written to make the viewer be drawn into their world. As a viewer, all you can do is think and think and try to look for answers to the questions that the movie proposed.\"Their world\" is in my opinion the phrase that describes this story and the four lead characters the best. Each of them lives in a remote paradise-looking place where they spend each day with the other three people. For a long time only they knew about their relationship. It was as if they lived inside their own bubble of happiness, their own world where all they did was go along with their feelings without thinking of the consequences. When the bubble met the real world and popped, the splashes of the it made a huge impact that left several people in pain and several relationships destroyed.In my opinion the free-floating dock where the characters meet multiple times throughout different stages of their relationships is the symbol for this bubble, while the sea around it is the conventional, \"normal\" world. The ending shows the four of them meeting on the dock yet again. There is no conversation, just a simple \"good morning\". There is no physical content, it is just the four of them lying next to each other like they used to before. I searched for explanations and looked for it in multiple reviews but didn't find much. In my eyes, however, it symbolized the fact that they have returned to the beginning point. They are back in the bubble just like they used to be. What it clearly means for their relationships and the future of them is left up to the viewer's interpretation -- much like the rest of the movie.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance"}, "index_85": {"review_id": "rw3427091", "reviewer": "brianberta", "movie": "the help", "rating": "3", "review_summary": "I've seen much better", "review_date": "6 March 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "If you want to watch a film about racism, I do not recommend this one. While it may do a few things right, it suffers from numerous flaws. I didn't really care for this film that much, and it could have been a lot better.A young woman named Skeeter who is trying to become an author during the civil rights movement of the 60's decides to write a book detailing the lives of African-American maids and how they're treated. As the word about her book gets out, many more African-American maids come to her to help her write her book by telling her how they are treated.The first issue I have with this film is that it's overly emotionally manipulative. At some points in the movie, it feels like director Tate Taylor is grasping for straws to find anything which might draw an emotion out of the audience. This can be distracting at some points in the film because it's used a lot. In this case, however, I found most of its attempts to be ineffective at giving me a connection with the characters. The only one which was effective for me was the one used at the very end of the film. However, none of the other sad scenes in the film worked. I find this flaw a lot with feel good movies, and I wish that directors would try to avoid this as this is one of the main things which can bring me out of a movie.Another flaw is that most of the characters are overly clich\u00e9 and are caricatures. The characters seem to be everything you would expect to find in a film about racism. They make almost every white character to be a racist. Also, they make it so one progressive white character is able to see through the conflict and want to help the African-Americans maids in the film. Also, some of the black characters are very stereotypical and somewhat racist. The film makes it so that almost every black character loves fried chicken. In fact, they show this several points in the film. I really wished that they didn't do it because I found that to be kind of jarring. Since about all of the main characters felt reductive, it sort of took me out of the film.Another area the film misses in is that it doesn't show the absolute lows of racism. It doesn't need to be hyper-violent, but it should at least have enough violence to make it hit hard enough with the viewer. Since it doesn't show enough violence to give it an accurate portrayal of how life really was like for African-Americans in the 60's, I felt like the movie was too safe. A movie about racism being too safe is never a good thing. There are some movie plots and settings that I feel require for their movies to focus on the absolute lows of their setting. Racism is definitely one of them.Also, the main character, Skeeter, feels very anachronistic. It feels like Kathryn Stocket (the author of the book this film is based on) projected her own modern-day fulfillment to have such a progressive minded, white female. If someone like Skeeter wanted to write a book about interviews from African Americans from the 60's, those kinds of people usually came from the North and even then, they would be treated with violence. However, to have that character come from the South and write a book like that - it's simply wish fulfillment on Stocket's part. No book like \"The Help\" would have ever existed and it would've never been published during the 60's. Because of this, the atmospheric feeling of institutional racism does not feel very realistic in the film.Another flaw is the movie's overall length. I feel like the movie could've been a lot shorter. I'll even argue that it could've been cut down to just under 2 hours. Since it was relatively slow-paced, there were several times when the film didn't have my full attention and other times when I wanted it to end or get going with its main story. One of the plot points which could have been cut from the film was Skeeter's relationship with Stuart. I didn't buy for a second that Skeeter would've been attracted to him and would've gone out with him for quite some time. Wouldn't she have concluded from the beginning that he was a racist and not want to have anything to do with him?With that being said, that's not to say that I liked nothing about this film. To me, its biggest strength lies in the acting. Many actresses give amazing performances. Emma Stone, Viola Davis, and Octavia Spencer both give amazing performances and they helped to carry the movie very well. However, some performances weren't that good. Bryce Dallas Howard gave an overall good performance, but there were some times when she sounded over-the-top. Also, Jessica Chastain wasn't able to act convincingly as a drunk without sounding annoying and cringeworthy. It had weak performances, but most of them were overall solid.Also, the film does a good job at reminding us that the African-Americans who wrote the book had to face not only threats of violence from the hateful backlash of angry whites in their hometown, but also a multiplicity of indignities in their hometowns, including being forced to sit at the back of buses and having to use separate restrooms.In conclusion, while this film does a few things right, it is weighed down by being overly emotionally manipulative, using several clich\u00e9 caricatures, not hitting the lows of racism well enough, an anachronistic plot, and the slow-pacing. Of course, the majority of its acting and how it displays hardships that African-Americans faced are good, but that's really all I can say for this film. It could've been great, but it didn't do that much for me.", "publish_date": "2011", "category": "Drama"}, "index_86": {"review_id": "rw2960421", "reviewer": "bob the moo", "movie": "her", "rating": null, "review_summary": "Good ideas and generally works but it is overlong and forces its emotional importance too much, ultimately undermining itself", "review_date": "14 February 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "I recently watched the Charlie Brooker film Be Right Back, which is part of the Black Mirror series (one which is flawed but I would still recommend to anyone) and I mention this because thematically that film has a lot in common with this film. Those who want to look smart will tell one that this film is a lift of Brooker's but this is not the case, although it is true that both deal with a person having an emotional relationship with a programmed personality. In Her we see online letter writer Theodore going through a divorce and feeling disconnected from the world. He purchases a new operating system which boasts an adapting and learning virtual personality, one which unsurprisingly he develops a chemistry with as she helps him work on his organization. Soon they are hanging out together and something approaching a relationship begins to develop.The ideas and themes within this film are very interesting and mostly very well presented as it deals with the idea of virtual personalities and software that \"knows\" us and is able to adapt and learn to appeal to us and interact in a way that fits us personally. Perhaps once such an idea would have seemed far-fetched but nowadays we already have websites suggesting other products or people or films or music we might like based on our habits or purchases, so it is not a million years to go beyond this. So in terms of the concept of the film, I liked it and was already sold and having recently really enjoyed Be Right Back, I was looking forward to Her. As usual any film that is tied up in the Oscars will be subject to hype and I did try to ignore it but this is a film that I do think has been overpraised because, while it is a pretty good film, it has plenty of flaws and is not as good as you will have heard (and without a doubt if you are watching it in early 2014, you will have heard about how good it is).The central ideas provide a link to those of us who make use of the internet, which is most of us. We have friendships going back a decade where we have never actually met the people involved; we have real-life relationships that have become virtual as they migrate onto Facebook status updates etc being the only point of contact as the real connection fades; some of us may even have connections with online characters who are no more real than their pixel visualization. The point is that the film will speak to many viewers in this sense but in terms of the romance side, it is probably aimed at those in their late 20's or older who have seen relationships start, change and then drift apart. So essentially I am target audience for this film but yet for me it didn't quite work as it thinks it did.The first problem is the length because at 2 hours it is about 20 minutes longer than it needs to be and this is time that could easily have been found since there is a lot in here that doesn't add much. The bigger problem is that the film is intimate, vulnerable and personal \u2013 well, sorry, it being this way isn't a problem but it knowing that it is, is the problem and it forcing this aspect is the problem. Through the cinematography, the music, the performances and everything we have a film that really strives to be emotionally deep and impacting, rather than simply being that way. It is hard to describe but it starts to feel forced and artificial at several points and it blocks what it should be doing. What remains still works, still engages and still provides food for thought but it tries too hard for too long to convince you of its emotional impact that it overdoes it too easily. It is frustrating because the simplest moments of the film work the best but it soon pushes past this and loses the idea in its unique version of sentimentality. The direction, the look of the film and Phoenix's performance is part of this. The latter is a shame because on the face of it Phoenix is great \u2013 he is on screen alone for most of the time but works very well as a vulnerable soul finding a foothold \u2013 but around him the film and this performance combine to be excessive and I grew tired of his slumped sadness contrasted with smiling contentment. Johansson is better although without a body she will never be equally considered for the awards. Supporting roles range from the out of place (Wiig) through to the \"nice money for a few minutes work\" (Cox).Her is one of the films hyped to greatness in the 2014 awards season and frankly it doesn't deserve it. The ideas behind it would work better if it were a shorter film which doesn't overplay its hand but lets it come out in more of a natural fashion. As much as I liked aspects of it and specific moments, it doesn't deliver as it should and it is disappointing for what it doesn't do just as much as it pleases for what it does. People talking about Be Right Back in the context of Her ripping it off are wrong in terms of their subject but correct in bringing up Brooker's film \u2013 those watching Her should be aware of it, but not because it is a copy but rather because it is the superior film of the two.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_87": {"review_id": "rw5723849", "reviewer": "haskellhello", "movie": "sucker punch", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "Truly magnificent action-fantasy scenes that just barely stay grounded in a dark story", "review_date": "10 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "I don't write a lot of reviews but I think this one is thorough and fair. It has no spoilers.To say that Snyder used the confusing plot as an excuse to hit us with some of the best eye candy on the market would be a lie. There is definitely a story being told. Theres even reasons behind some of the confusing elements. Yet at the end of the day, it's just a little too hard to follow. For me the characters come across as underdeveloped, even though they DO show a LOT of emotion on screen. I think the film would've benefitted from a bit more quality small talk to make us fall in love with each character, which the film had almost none of. It makes sense though that every line had to be plot oriented when the biggest issue with a film like this is connecting the fantasy to the \"real\" storyline. I will say that the main female cast is nothing short of excellent both in the action and in the acting departments, and you will easily connect to them even without the exposition I wanted. You could totally argue that it's more realistic with how the characters interact with real emotion and they just don't explain why they are how they are because by the time we see the film they already know each other. That argument would be perfectly fair. The film probably just needed to be a little longer, and there's a good chance that the 18 minutes of extended footage in the Blu-ray cut make a big impact on the completeness of the experience. The fantasy sequences REALLY deliver, while the real world scenes feel like they don't get enough storytelling done. Seriously tho, the action is so damn good. Some of the camera work you just won't be able to find anywhere else, the slow-mo is used both generously and effectively, and the girls are incredibly acrobatic and absolutely ooze dramatic flair. It's bad ass. The real world plot feels like it takes too long to confusingly explain a simple plan. It was strange to me how the dialogue was often on the flat side, yet the narration at the end was so deep. The music is consistently bad ass and effectively adds to the atmosphere.There were a couple moments where they failed to maintain ultra realism, like when a bad guy walks in on the gang plotting. Right after he leaves, 4-5 seconds later, they resume their full volume conversation. This vibe lingered throughout the movie too much and dropped it from 8 to 7 for me.Bottom line: if you have a taste for things dark and bad ass AND you think you're pretty good at reading between the lines, this is 100% a must-see movie. The story really is there, it just takes a lot of effort to fully grasp with what's shown on screen. If you're a Shakespearean-style critic who only cares for intricate dialogue and thurough plot development, skip it. If you're an action junkie and love seeing hot girls twirling through the air shooting guns and swinging swords at often truly formidable foes in well-shot slow-mo, it should be on your bucket list.

But they must try and either succumb to expectations of settling down with a man and getting married. Or to fight against the power of men and make it on there own. Wow what a beautifully crafted movie with so much warmth,charm and fantastic acting lets talk about this more in depth.First of all the films cinematography and aesthetics were stunning. This film was simply stunning to look at. It was so simplistic and yet so effective, i felt like i was in a massive story book. With also breathtaking dance routines and costumes that really caught your eye and left you in awe of what you were watching.Next the film was actually fairly funny and it also had a fantastic amount of emotional weight to it as well. The family dynamic between the four sisters and the mother bought a lot of relatable humour for me. As i have two sisters which made me connect slightly more with the humour that was being used. Florence Pugh who we will be talking about again soon bought me the most humour as her brutal honesty bought a few much needed chuckles. And the film also had a perfect blend of emotional weight to it as well. The film spent so much time developing all of the sisters stories that you couldn't help feeling emotionally connected to each of them. And to see the collapse of the youngest sister ( Eliza Scorn) health was incredibly heartbreaking, and seeing her death and the impact on Jo ( Saorise Ronan) was heartbreaking but also inspiring as this is what motivated Jo to right her most impactful and successful book.Next the film had a charming tone throughout,and the script was phenomenally clever and impactful. As previously mentioned seeing the family dynamic and the bond that the whole family had was truly charming and heartwarming. As it reminded me of the bond i have with my family which made me feel comfortable and at home whilst watching. And the script wow was phenomenal. Despite it being set a long time ago the script felt so modern and reflected on society today. With some brutal truths of the roles of women in society in the past and today. With some impactful lines from Saoirse Ronan and Florence pugh.Now before i get into my final positives. I do just have to say my one negative that stopped the film from being perfect for me. The film slightly overused its usage of flashbacks. So it firstly made it fairly confusing at first to know what time period you were in. And then it made the narrative slightly clunky. But this was only occasionally so didn't really effect my overall opinion of the movie.Now time for my final positives. The casting was perfect. All the performances were great and i had 3 standouts in particular. I thought the films casting was perfect for every character. And it was filled with both experienced talent and up and coming talent perfectly. And everyone did a fantastic performance. So i haven't mentioned Eliza Scorn,Emma Watson,Laura Dern or Meryl streep in my key standouts but they all did great jobs. But my key standouts were Saoirse Ronan,Florence Pugh and Timothee Chalamet. Saoirse's performance was incredible and oscar worthy in my opinion. She put so much effort and passion into her performance that you believed everything she said and did throughout the whole film making her character truly inspiring. Florence pugh was phenomenal really showing her acting versatility. With both the serious and funny moments making me excited for her future roles she takes on. And finally Timothee Chalamet who held his own in a rightfully so female dominated movie. He was charming throughout. And he also showed a great contrast with his character of the mischievous and troublesome side to him, but also his sensitive and charming side and Timothee portrayed this perfectly. Also making me excited for his future work.Overall despite a slight over usage of flashbacks.

The build up around the jostle that wakes Chuck up, the storm outside, the quick look at a screen showing them off course, the increased turbulence, the sudden explosion, the loss of cabin pressure, the crash, the sinking fuselage, the raft finding its way to the surface with Chuck desperately clinging on, and then the camera pulling back slowly as Chuck, a small figure on the big ocean only lit by lightning strikes, gets steadily smaller and smaller. It's a bravura sequence that uses image and sound perfectly, planting the audience at the center of the chaos without ever losing sight of Chuck or the overall movement around him, keeping the evolving action clear while providing us our emotional groundwork in Chuck.Once on that island, the movie markedly changes on purpose. The first section of the film was loud and busy with Chuck dominating conversations constantly as he lived by a clock. Suddenly, there's no one to talk to and time doesn't matter. That change is what makes the life on the island so stark. Opening the movie with this would be one thing, dropping us into it after thirty minutes of completely different modes of storytelling is something else. The audience can feel as isolated and alone as Chuck as he calls out impotently to no one while quietly picking up a handful of floating packages on the shore (and sorting them by destination, of course) and figures out how to survive. The grounded nature of Chuck's search for a way to survive is compelling even as it covers small ground. Fire, of course, is something that we can completely take for granted, but when the only food Chuck can manage to eat is the meat of coconuts because crab legs are goop without being cooked we can understand the quiet determination and loud outbursts of frustration that grip Chuck as he tries to make fire for the first time.This is the introduction of the other main character in the film, Wilson the volleyball. There's a basic narrative need to give Chuck someone to talk to without him just talking to himself, and the creation of Wilson is a good place to direct that energy. Born from his own blood after an accident with the fire sticks, Wilson provides a face that Chuck can speak to, sort out his thoughts, and let the audience know what Chuck ends up planning to do. That there is an emotional connection to Wilson at all is really derived from Chuck's very understandable need to simply have someone else in his life other than the sand and trees around him. His sole companion for four years means something to him, and because we can understand the depth of Chuck's plight we can understand that emotional connection to a smear of blood on a white volleyball. Maybe we can or cannot share in it, but we can certainly understand it.There's a time jump of four years, and the physical transformation of Hanks from one side of that jump to the other is rather stark. The production famously shut down for an entire year (when Zemeckis made What Lies Beneath with the same crew) so that the pudgy Tom Hanks could slim down to his far thinner frame for the second half of the film, but that's only part of the transformation. Hanks was nominated for an Oscar in this role, and he deserved that nomination. The boisterous and gregarious fixer becomes incredibly different through those four years. He's quieter and more manic on the island, and when he gets off the island, suddenly surrounded by the world he had so easily fit into before, he's so quiet and small in comparison to who he was. The man who was so comfortable in the middle of a crowded conversation now looks like he would rather sink through the floor than bear another minute of it, but he's just too meek to do anything about it. That personal transformation is far more impressive than the physical transformation.The effort to get off the island is the sort of goal based narrative that Zemeckis was so familiar with. This is really the core of the idea that this is the ultimate Zemeckis film, the goal is the only thing for such a long stretch. Chuck decides that he can use the half of a port-a-potty that washes up on his shore as a sail, but he only has a few months to form the necessary rope, build the raft, stock it, and launch it before the weather turns against him until the next year. The effort to make all of that happens is surprisingly compelling because we have a clear goal, clear stakes, and a likeable protagonist that we can root for all wrapped up together and focused on with clear-eyed purpose. It helps that the combination of on location filming and special effects are so seamless that everything about the production feels completely real.The advertising famously gave away the ending of the film in the trailer and made it clear that it was giving away the ending. Occasionally trailers will show you shots from late in the film, but in the context of the trailer you don't realize it (the trailer for Eastern Promises has the final shot of the entire film in the trailer, for example), but it was obvious that the trailer was giving everything away. Zemeckis called it a marketing decision based on research that showed that people liked to know exactly what they were getting before they walked in, using McDonald's food as an example (he could have potentially used popular police procedurals like CSI as another). This really irritated some reviewers like Roger Ebert who couldn't get past the film's marketing to judge the movie and its ending on their own.So, let me talk about the ending and why it's great.Chuck gets off the island and he's a different man. He no longer cares about time, but he does still love Kelly. And yet, it's been more than four years since he left. She may have been a constant for him in a place without time, but time continued on without him. Kelly grieved and moved on, marrying and having a daughter. At the beginning of the movie, Chuck was so concerned with the time around his job that he never made the time for Kelly, the two needing to negotiate schedule books to discover when they would next see each other when Chuck gets called away for his fateful flight to Asia. Now, returned to Memphis, he understands how to appreciate time, and he can no longer have the one thing he wants most in the world. He could have had her had he prioritized her, staying home on Christmas instead of going to Asia, but after he made that decision there's no turning back. He has to move on, just like she did. It's a wonderful embrace of the central idea that runs through the whole film.Cast Away is a great technical achievement, which is no surprise from Zemeckis, but it's also incredibly intelligent thematically and mature cinematically. Zemeckis has grown into an incredibly assured filmmaker. I hope he doesn't fall in love with weird computer animation, though.

Even in the couple minutes of footage I knew there was going to be strong acting.This movie is not perfect by any means, but in all honesty I do not think there is a real thing as a \"perfect movie\". This is not a movie for the average film-goer. \"Out of the Furnace\" falls into the same category as films such as \"In Bruges\" and \"Killing them Softly\". What all of these films have in common is that they all are slow, somewhat tedious character studies, which is not going to be appreciated by the masses. All of these films are brutal in their own way and we get attached to characters that are somewhat repulsive in nature, but yet we feel and connect with their emotions.\"Out of the Furnace\" burns with emotion. I believe a film is great when the narrative keeps you engaged and on your toes. You really don't know where the story is going to take you. The story is not the most important element of this film. The substance and beautifully acted characters are what keep you drawn in.Casey Affleck's raw emotion when breaking down to Bale's character shook me to my core. That scene left me trying to understand my own life and what purpose that I serve. It was heartbreaking to watch because I have friends and family that have experienced the atrocities of war and Affleck's brutally honest emotions created an unforgettable scene.There is so much heartbreak in this movie that it is difficult to watch. Christian Bales eyes convey all of the heartbreak and disappointment in Russell Baze's life. Woody Harrelson's, Harlan Degroat is acted with supreme repulsiveness. I don't think any other actor could have pulled off that type of wretchedness, but yet you still feel a connection to that character.The surroundings are hauntingly realistic. Being from Cleveland and in the steel industry, the portraits of small steel town Pennsylvania are all too real in all of its non glorified grittiness. For those who have no experience in that type of environment, I hope you can try to appreciate the filmmakers vision of bringing the harsh reality of the decaying American dream front and center in the most uncomfortable way.\"Out of the Furnace\" creates a visually haunting and stunning experience with legendary acting that will most certainly stick with you long after you have completed the film, For your entertainment only, need not apply.

It was basically what I anticipated it to be and that isn't a bad thing at all. Lone Survivor is a riveting, dramatic, well acted and often hard to watch story based on the impossible survival of a US Armed Forces soldier. I think under the proper direction and script this could have been as big and as accepted as Zero Dark Thirty (an already completely inferior film in my books) What I mean to say is that this powerful story could have been less mainstreamed to be more critically accepted and more focused on the powerful emotion behind it. Instead they chose to aim for the general public as its demographic and that's okay because it is very entertaining but how much of it was accurate? Honestly, I don't know the answer to that. Perhaps I should read the book but I kept questioning whether these four men were truly shot multiple times, time after time like they were bulletproof and kept going...including one of them being shot in the head and still upright and talking. All of this is indeed possible but I want to know whether it was realistic to THIS situation. After a little bit of a slow start, the film really starts rolling and will leave you breathless. It has easily one of the best and horrifying scenes of someone falling down a mountainside. It literally felt painful to watch it.I am really becoming a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I think he's a very talented star, one of the best in Hollywood right now, and he does action very, very well. This is no exception. I thought maybe being that he was such a big star that he might not fit into this cast but he does...flawlessly. He brings a raw emotion and power to the role and he doesn't start as the key player but by the end he is the clear cut star. The first part of the film struggles to really get you familiar with the main crew. They drop obvious breadcrumbs like one of them is buying a horse for his woman, the other is dating or married to an Asian woman...things like that. It isn't until half way through the film where you really start to understand and connect to these characters. Taylor Kitsch was my least favourite on the team. No offence to him but his character felt like it was overly dramatic. His death scene felt ridiculous under the circumstances of a movie. The slow motion falling, the heroic pose on his knees on a mountainside with the sun rising over the beautiful landscape...it was hokey. It was like they were trying to spoof an action hero using Kitsch and his performance suffers because of it. Emile Hirsch on the other hand was excellent. He was charismatic, interesting, and made his character stand out and feel believable. Ben Foster...man I love this kid...and I always forget about him because he'll do a big movie and then vanish for a long while. While here he is again in the best role in the movie I think. He does an amazing job of making you feel like you're right there with him and his intensity and emotion easily trumps everyone else in the movie. Foster needs a breakout role and soon because he is very talented. Eric Bana and Alexander Ludwig round out supporting cast that were worth mentioning in very small roles but important and effective.Something I really liked about this film was that it wasn't your typical American military film where everything works out great and the mission is accomplished and go join the military now. This was a brutal and horrifyingly bad mission gone very very wrong. It is more a story of survival than it is military. Peter Berg irritates me as a director. He has a lot of experience but I've never cared much for his style for some reason. All his films just feel okay to me like there is more that could have been done but he doesn't bother because he's aiming for a certain demographic and \"they won't care.\" I'm completely putting words in his mouth but it just feels that way. Lone Survivor could have been a WOW and instead its a...yah that was good. The problem is that I feel like this powerful survival story is mostly forgettable once you're out of the theatre. That reduces it to mindless entertaining and a story like this should be anything but. It is visceral at times, powerful, violent, entertaining...it is absolutely worth seeing. I sort of expected more emotion while watching it though one particular line almost got to me. One of the best scenes, acted and directed, is the scene when they are trying to decide what to do about the compromise in front of them. It is interesting and fascinating to watch how that unfolds. Check it out and take it for what it is and you will enjoy it. 8/10", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Action,Biography,Drama"}, "index_93": {"review_id": "rw6080349", "reviewer": "M5TO", "movie": "i'm thinking of ending things", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "Alternative explanation post (compatible with book)", "review_date": "10 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "The entire trip stands for a relationship between two emotionally unavailable people: a closet narcissist (a janitor who dreams of receiving Nobel prices and standing ovations) and an overachieving student who is afraid of abandonment (she is a physicist, a poet, a painter, a cinema critic, studies gerontology, and when she sees Jake and herself, she sees two perfect people, loving each other, getting married and the relationship ending abruptly, at the hands of an unidentified threat. Her younger self is afraid of the future, of death, and doesn't want to go forward).Although they have a few good conversations and seemingly intellectual connections, the relationship quickly becomes cold, dark, stormy, the passenger feels that things do not make sense, there are inconsistencies (new swings in front of old empty houses), never ending stops (at the parents), unwanted detours (at the ice cream parlour) and diminishing trust (on the way to the highschool). She wants to stop early on, feels the need to have a closer look at things, but the car just goes on, the \"irrelationship\" keeps going.The closet narcissist is in the driver's seat. He barely knows her name, doesn't really see or know her, simply sees her as an \"it\", an extension of himself, who is there to validate him, to make him feel worthy and confident. Also, she is beautiful in her own way, a way that he can feel comfortable with, that he doesn't see as a threat (like the blond girls from his high school, who made fun of him), and this is also why he can tolerate to be with her.She is avoidant/dismissive, she admits to herself that they have a great relationship, a true attachment, but she doesn't know that she cannot really tolerate intimacy (and this is why she is with a guy like that in the first place) and thinks that she should end things, without really knowing why. Because she has actually found ways to feel worthy (overachieving and being successful at it), in contrast with him, she does not need others' validation and she might actually truly be comfortable with ending relationships (but this part is unclear, because she is also insecure in her own way).Being in a relationship with him involves \"visiting his parents\", being exposed to his childhood trauma: parents who only value achievements because they live through him (they have their own issues, poor health/lack of education and he is their \"it\", their object, they obtain validation through him, his achievements). They never value who he really is, hence his feeling of worthlessness, his need for external validation through extraordinary achievements, even if the achievement is here another (objectified) person.He feels so much toxic shame about who he is (a janitor and not a physicist) that in addition to being a closet narcissist, he is a controller: on the one hand he is very diligent but on the other, everything is on his terms, she will only go where he wants her to go (not the basement, for instance), she will only get as close to him as he will let her while not really showing her who he truly is (someone who is really just using her because he feels empty and sad, because his parents were really sweet but cold, never truly there for him).The more they progress in the ride, the more she understands the extent of his general lack of attunement. He doesn't hear her, she has to raise her voice, get angry, repeat what she wants, that she wants to go \"home\". They are not really going home and she feels like they are not really going anywhere. He repeatedly abandons her, when he is scared (at the ice cream parlour), when he is angry (at the high school). Her subconscious is calling her more and more often, telling her that something is really wrong here.And indeed, there is something wrong, because he is so self-centered that it's all really only happening in his head. This is a one-sided relationship. He actually never manages to connect with her or anyone else.This is the best film I have seen in a very long time.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Drama,Thriller"}, "index_94": {"review_id": "rw2860905", "reviewer": "donuthaters12", "movie": "the tree of life", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "Wonderfully Acted, Beautifully Shot, And Has A Strong Idea", "review_date": "31 August 2013", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "I really didn't know what I expected from myself after watching The Tree Of Life. Would I be satisfied? Would I think it's pretentious? Would it's ambition satisfy me? Could it still hold it's ground on subsequent viewings? The answer to all those questions is yes.This Tree of Life was written by Terrence Malick. This would be my second film from him, the first being The Thin Red Line, and I came into this not with high hopes as others have dismissed the film as dull and I didn't find The Thin Red Line as interesting in it's story and the questions that was being asked (granted I have only seen the film once, so it my opinion may change in the future). This film gave me hope in Malick and that his work does have value. The Tree of Life tells the story, though not linearly, of this nuclear family from Austin, Texas and also in the middle of the story is the painting of the creation of light. The film's plot doesn't scream engaging on paper but once it starts, it's hard to stop as the film asks questions that makes the audience reflect on. The film discusses the existence and role of god to us on a personal level and also at the big picture. It may be hard to engage to this film in a spiritual level if one is not in touch with religion but if one has understanding of science and the development of life from the big bang, this film explores that too. The bulk of the film explores the growth of Jack, the eldest son, and this is where I connected the most as so much of what happens throughout his childhood is empathetic. My childhood may not be exactly the same as his but the idea and logic is the same. This is where the film has made a huge impact on me, as countless times it has made me reflect on myself, past and present, and see which path am I headed. The only issue I have with this film is that Sean Penn's adult Jack was very underused.Terrence Malick's direction here is passionate. The man has taken emotions, values, ideas, logic, philosophy and love, from which I assume he has experienced, into this film. The film feels very personal, in particular the arc with Jack's childhood. Malick has not chosen a side, religion or nature, in this film but rather explore both and show how it has impacted their son who has grown up embracing both. The film's pacing may be slow and tiresome for some people but if one puts their whole selves into it then they will be guaranteed an experience that would probably change their perception of life.The first thing I noticed about The Tree of Life, was that the film is absolutely stunning. It's beautiful from start to finish, and the credit goes both to Malick and the film's cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki. I have not seen Malick's other post-Thin Red Line films so this is the first time I have seen a Malick-Lubezki film, but I have seen his photography on films like A Series of Unfortunate Events, Cat In The Hat, and judging from the trailer I saw from the upcoming film Gravity, he knows how to the film's image look iconic and stylish. In this film he uses a lot natural light and this creates a more naturalistic effect. The footage from the 50's in this film feels like a gorgeous picture perfect moment on a home video. It brings the audience in like we're part of the family and that we can feel what they're going through. The scenes that show the creation and development of life is more of a showcase of special effects. I think it is an amazing triumph, it feels like something off a documentary but at the same time it still retains this cinematic quality that make the scenes even more gorgeous.The film's score is composed by Alexandre Desplat who has worked on films like Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Moonrise Kingdom (a personal favorite of mine), Ides of March, and Argo. His work here is definitely a treat, when the score comes on whether it's on the scene with the cells or the scenes where Pitt and Chastain are just lying down on the grass, it definitely catches my attention. The score fits to what Malick is trying to show us. The score at times has this aura of spirituality which I liked, as it made the connection between the family and god all the more stronger.The acting in this film is not what I call groundbreaking, as these actors are not portraying roles that will show off the highest of their abilities. These characters are something that everyone has; a father, a mother, a family. These characters are therefore simple yet true and personal. Every actor in this film shines, in particular Pitt and Chastain. Both have fantastic chemistry and has created something that people can empathise and connect with. There were times that Pitt has made me think about my own dad being strict and Chastain similarly to my mother speaking about religion. The children; McCracken, Eppler, and Sheridan; were great and they seem to have great chemistry and we buy that they are brothers. Sean Penn was decent in this and didn't really have a lot to work with but this is due to the film not utilizing his character to it's potential.The film overall has made an impact on me and definitely be something i will keep coming back to whenever I need to search myself. The film is wonderfully acted, beautifully shot and has a strong idea. This film is something that will have people come back to later on and discover it's appeal.", "publish_date": "2011", "category": "Drama,Fantasy"}, "index_95": {"review_id": "rw2894118", "reviewer": "The_After_Movie_Diner", "movie": "the broken circle breakdown", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Belgians, Beards, Bluegrass and Death", "review_date": "25 October 2013", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Belgians, Bluegrass, Beards, Tattoos, Child Cancer, Marriage, Death, Birth, Life, Sex, Religion, Science, Politics, America, Birds, Stars and Suicide. The Broken Circle Breakdown is about all this and more. It's a phenomenal, brilliant, difficult, depressing, heart warming and joyously musical movie from Belgium by writer/director Felix Van Groeningen starring the supremely talented Johan Heldenbergh and Veerle Baetens. Johan Heldenbergh was also a co-writer of and performer in the original stage play and even learned to play guitar, mandolin and banjo to perform the lead role of Didier who is fascinated by America and bluegrass music.The film tells the tragic story of Didier, the bearded bluegrass fanatic and passionate atheist, Elise/Alabama the head strong, mysterious, confused, emotional, sexy and lost tattoo shop owner and Maybelle their doomed daughter. The film chronicles their lives together, through the good and the bad, in a nonlinear narrative. The emotions involved and the relevant life moments, though, flow in a perfectly understandable and pleasing way. It's not unlike someone, sat round a table, telling you their life story. It wouldn't go from start to finish, there would be moments where they'd have to go back and fill in the blanks for you, that's the nature of this film. The characters meet, fall in love, find joy, get pregnant, face that hurdle, have a child, suffer that child getting leukemia and passing away and then the rest of the film shows how both Didier and Elise handle that while also taking time to cover the religious, spiritual, political and scientific ramifications of that. Didier is thrown more passionately into his steadfast belief in science and the political, religious fundamentalists who would block its exploration, while also desperately, emotionally and lovingly trying to keep his marriage and music together and Elise begins to find beauty and solace in notions of re-incarnation or the spiritual realm but also retreats from a situation she sees no remedy to and slowly, tragically abandons everything. Interspersed through all this tough life stuff is some of the most exquisite live performance of bluegrass, country and Americana roots music by a brilliant team of bearded Belgians. It's one of the best movie soundtracks of this kind, in my humble opinion, this side of O Brother, Where Art Thou? The music, overseen and, very often, written originally by Bjorn Eriksson is most definitely the soul of this film and where it really hits its stride in terms of displaying truth, beauty and raw emotion. The whole film could've been dialogue free and told in just that incredible series of performances such is the skill of the actors and musicians. It helps immensely that the two leads perform the songs themselves and so can imbue them with the emotional journey their character is taking. During the rendition of 'Will the Circle Be Unbroken' We see attraction, amazement and the first flickers of love in Elise's face from the audience. During \"Cowboy\" Didier connects with Elise, shows off, struts, feels confident and she responds with excitement, awe and lust. During \"Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn\", shown in a fantastic montage that goes from Didier practicing in the caravan, passed a beautifully photographed, fireside hoedown and up to the point when Elise finally joins her man on stage, you see her blossom and Didier unable to believe his luck. You even see the band buoyed and pushed forward by the way everything is gelling. Elise's solo performance of \"Wayfaring Stranger\" is so powerful and perfect that it doesn't really need the intercut images of poor Maybelle's fate, as everything is on Veerle Baetens' face and in the words of the song. This continues throughout the film with everyone hitting the right note so as to make the emotions utterly raw and believable in a way that only the combination of great direction, editing, performance, music and film can. In what might be one of the most beautiful performances of the entire film, Elise joins Didier and the band on stage one last time to perform a duet version of \"If I needed You\". It is the point where everything shifts and the two lovers are moving apart, Didier reaching out and Elise retreating. It's so sad, awkward and stunningly simplistic.These musical interludes and their deep, clever, subtle storytelling are not, in any way, too obvious, mawkish, sentimental, over wrought or manipulative. They are woven so perfectly into the broken narrative that they enhance the journey you're on with the cast. It helps, of course, that I am already a fan of this music and it helps too that the film is photographed, directed and edited in such a wonderful way as to make even the slightest nod of a head, or the move of a hand poetic and rich. The colours, the grain, the lighting, the sound and the shots are so full of detail, texture, shadow as to both be seemingly realistic, you can feel the warm fire in a cold farm house, and utterly artistic, vibrant and clearly a movie.Is it a tough watch, a tad depressing and definitely melodramatic? yes. It wasn't the love story I was expecting by a long shot but whereas other films I have seen are just relentlessly dreary, depressing, slow and devoid of ideas and emotions, Broken Circle Breakdown can be watched over and over again for the depth, detail, performances and ideology it has. I took from the film that life is meant to be held on to and fought for, not given up on or run away from and while finding solace in the religious or spiritual is all very well, there is more than enough beauty, mystery, music and reason to keep living, as much as you can, day by day, on earth, no matter how hard it gets.

I saw this film because my mother LOVED it. She was stressing to me how fantastic this one was and how Anne Hathaway deserved the Oscar etc. The end result was my questioning whether this really was the musical of emotion and feeling.The plot is that Jean Valjean is a prisoner on parole but can't get a job because the warden, Javert, has stated that he is a dangerous man. In a time of rape and murder what was Valjean's crime to make Javert so obsessed? He stole a loaf of bread...From what I have been told thats in the play too but it becomes insane when this character torments Valjean for 30 years and his crime was stealing a loaf of bread? For the musical of feeling, I feel no character motivation for that to happen.Okay so Valjean breaks his parole and becomes mayor in 8 years in a jump cut that quite frankly happens so fast that it doesn't seem real at first (great development there guys!) and is called into his factory to settle a dispute between Fantine and the other workers. The Forman kicks Fantine out and because she has a daughter, she sells everything she has to provide for her and it eventually leads to the famous \"I Dreamed A Dream\". Whats my beef? We only know Fantine for half an hour of the entire film. We should care...why?Javert notices that the Mayor looks a lot like the criminal he's obsessing over and after a total of 3 conversations he notices that it IS him. Valjean, however, tries to respect the wishes of a dead Fantine and raise her daughter, Cosette who is being raised by Sacha Baron Coehn and Helena Bonham Carter whose characters are named...Cut to a mere 9 years later, we see Cosette as a teenager who falls in love with a boy named Marius at first glance. Marius is in the Revolution which is led by his friend whose name is...However Eponine (I'm not sure how its spelled and I'm too lazy to look it up) is in love with Marius and happens to be the daughter of Sacha Baron Coehn and Helena Bonham Carter and like many love triangles, the person that doesn't have the happy ending is given the most development. After Javert finds out that he has an obsession over Valjean again, Valjean decides to leave Paris...9 years there where Javert could come in at any moment and just NOW he decides to leave. But this upsets Cosette because shes in love with Marius who is beginning to build the barricades for the revolution. After they are delivered a note from a little boy who is one of the revolutionaries and is named...() anyway Valjean reads the letter and decides to help Marius in the revolution.Anyway the revolution goes belly side up, the revolutionaries are killed with the exception of Marius who is rescued by Valjean and taken to a hospital. Javert questions this act of kindness and his own morals which causes him to kill himself. Marius and Cosette marry and Valjean dies being carried away by the spirit of Fantine.What is my major problem with this movie? It has WAY Too much story. I have seen films that clock in two and a half hours and they have nowhere near this much plot. Its like if someone tried to adapt the Dark Knight movies in one condensed version. The plot is so overdetailed and so overdone that I don't feel a single moment where I connected with the characters and for a film thats title can be translated into \"The Miserable Ones\" to include no reason to care is a huge crime.The cinematography for this film is awful. I can name three different shot types that take up the majority of the movie; close up, tracking shot and crane shot. Because this film is shot so boringly and has no reason to connect with the characters, the whole film just becomes boring. Even the action scenes, its so tightly shot that you can NEVER see whats going on.I also don't think we need comedy in a film called \"The Miserable Ones\" I mean sure, Sacha Baron Coehn has his fans but his comedy in this film consisted of stealing things and Helena Bonham Carter raping Santa...this begs one question from me as a viewer \"What the hell am I watching?\"The only other real complaint is the live singing. I think the director used this as a gimmick to start some sort of musical trend...the reason why it never took off was because it produces horrible singing. I swear, the only really good singer was Hathaway and even then I like her performance in the final song, not I \"Dreamed A Dream\"In terms of films I didn't like, I have seen worse however this film just didn't work. I have never seen the play and this film committed the worst crime an adaptation can make, it turned me off to an even more extent.Overall if your a die hard fan, go see it, it doesn't mean you're an idiot but I'd prefer a version with more emotion please.EDIT: Oh and if you want my personal recommendation, go and watch the Les Miserables that was made in 1998. It sacrifices such things as comedy and unnecessary plot points in exchange for...emotional development, explanation of character motivation, beautiful cinematography. I wont spoil it for you but if you want to see what I'd call a good version of Les Mis, go for the 1998 version.", "publish_date": "2012", "category": "Drama,History,Musical"}, "index_97": {"review_id": "rw2938305", "reviewer": "estebangonzalez10", "movie": "saving mr. banks", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "But I feel what's to happen...All happened before.", "review_date": "9 January 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "\"Winds in the east...Mist coming in...Like something is brewing...About to begin...Can't put me finger...On what lies in store...But I feel what's to happen...All happened before.\"This was one of the few charming and sentimental films I fell for this year and a great deal has to do with the nostalgic effect that Mary Poppins has on me from my childhood. Yes it is schmaltzy at times and has a manipulative feel good vibe to it while at the same time self promoting itself, but I still was emotionally won over by this great story (and I don't care if most of it was made up, I still loved the film, I don't watch movies for facts). Saving Mr. Banks is smart and upbeat and will have you humming some of the songs from the beloved classic long after the credits have rolled. This is the best marketing Disney has come up with to promote Mary Poppins, and a lot of the success is owed to Emma Thompson for delivering such a powerful performance. Her character could be easily disliked for being so severe and unpleasant to others, but Thompson redeems her by allowing us to see where her pain comes from and how much the novel really meant to her. Tom Hanks is also great as Walt Disney and he would've received more recognition for this film if it weren't for those brilliant last 5 minutes in Captain Phillips that stole all the thunder from his performance here. Supporting roles from Colin Farrell, Paul Giamatti, and Jason Schwartzman make this an even more powerful film. Credit also must be given to the screenwriters, Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith, who managed to deliver a charming story while including engaging flashbacks of Travers' past. Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) promised his daughters that he would bring the beloved Mary Poppins novel to the big screen, but it turned out to be a difficult task considering he has spent the last 20 years trying to convince P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to obtain the rights of her novel. Convinced that Disney will ruin her beloved book, she refuses to do so. Travers' agent convinces her to travel to California to meet with Disney and try to come up with an agreement considering she is running out of money. Travers spends the next two weeks working with screenwriters (the Sherman brothers played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) at Disney's facility making sure that the screenplay is written exactly how she wants it. Things get complicated as she refuses to compromise to basic things Disney wants to include in the film. The film also presents flashbacks of Travers' childhood growing up in Australia with her father (Colin Farrell) who she absolutely adored but had a drinking problem that eventually ruined him. Her childhood experiences shaped the book and that is why she is so reluctant to let someone else change her story.Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for The Blind Side which was John Lee Hancock's prior film to this one and Emma Thompson might be a front runner to win for her performance as Travers. She makes this film much better than it actually is because if it wasn't for her Saving Mr. Banks would just be Disney schmaltz. I found it extremely hard not feel emotional about this film and it engaged me completely despite the lack of interest I had for the subject matter. I loved Mary Poppins as a kid, but that didn't mean I was interested in seeing a movie on how it was made. Despite all I've said about it being self promoting and manipulative I thought that what worked best was the integration of the flashbacks that allowed us to understand where Travers was coming from and reminds us how sometimes art is connected personally to the artist's past. That is why perhaps a film speaks to us in different ways because we too as an audience bring in our personal past and integrate it into a film finding a connection that perhaps others never will. That is the beauty of art, it affects us all in different ways.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Biography,Comedy,Drama"}, "index_98": {"review_id": "rw6124954", "reviewer": "sweidman-28016", "movie": "the devil all the time", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "A Very Investing Complicated Story", "review_date": "26 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "\"Some people were born just so they could be buried.\"There are elements that hold the movie back from being great. But that doesn't take away from how divisive it is. It's dark, gritty, and difficult to watch at points. Though technically not horror, it feels very much like one. Some of the imagery and awful events feel right out of a drama-horror. I don't want to say that it doesn't go full out with gore/intensity, but I wanted them to go full out. A few shots of gore last less than a second where I questioned what I actually saw. Minimal gore works to an advantage in occasion, but with how fast the movie goes and with so much to cover in the story it would've been nice to slow down to take everything. Unlike a common criticism from most audiences, I would've like the runtime to be just a little bit longer. It's already 135 minutes which is long enough but I would've liked more.Like I stated before, the story has some much to cover. The three different acts follow a different story that's connected to a stacked cast. Starting right of the bat, the movie introduces many characters. Honestly, it was hard to keep up. Already I knew everything would be connected. It's not till the second act where it makes more sense. To help explain, a narrator is there for the audience. If I could change one thing about the movie it would be the narrator. Voice overs dumbing down there story for the audience irritates me. Not everything is simplified, but most of what the narrator says is a given. One of the most emotional (intense) scenes is somewhat ruined by the voice over.A few of the scenes fall flat due to narration or other aspects, but the ensemble give it their all. If the competition weren't so high for other upcoming movies, this easily could've won awards. Though some characters don't even meet it feels as if there's a strong relationship whether it's characterization or acting-wise. A few actors don't get as much screen time and I wish they could've had more. Either their acting is just that good or I wanted more development. The best performances come from the closest characters: Eliza Scanlen, Tom Holland, and Robert Pattinson. Scanlen already has had a great year with Babyteeth and is now a must watch actor. She has an emotional role and makes it believable. I'm sure you've heard of how proud Tom Holland is of this role and movie. He proves that he can do something other than action/superhero movies. His return to drama since The Impossible is impeccable. Every minute spent on screen is a minute well spent. Holland truly immerses himself and the audience into the movie. If either of those performances didn't invest you, Robert Pattinson came and have another career defining performance. Ever since Good Time, or even going back to The Rover, Pattinson full sends his role. I wouldn't be surprised if he will be considered for awards at the end of the year. All I'll say is \"DELUSIONS!\"Antonio Campos directs well. With how tangled of a story if is, the end result untangles and ties itself together nicely. There are ruts along the way. The portrayal of how evil the characters are goes a little overboard with some characters, especially if they aren't developed enough. Many people will be turned off by how overboard the whole thing can get at times. But I found myself so invested that I couldn't look away. I checked my phone maybe once but the movie finished in a flash.

With this film, she leaves the same way.", "review_date": "12 June 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Leave it to Chantal Akerman to close her career \u2013 and then her life \u2013 with a film that is by turns boring, heartrending, funny, confounding, symbolic, literal, dreamlike, experimental and concrete.Akerman's mother Natalie mother was often her muse, either literally, as in the documentary \"Letters From Home, where a visual portrait of New York City is given context by the voice- over reading of letters from her mother, or more symbolically as in her 1974 masterpiece \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles\" \u2013 a terribly haunting but difficult 3 hour film about a single mother whose horribly boring on screen life - presented in glacial long shots of activities like cooking potatoes - covers up remarkable and deep secrets and emotions within. And here, right near the start of the film we see Akerman with her mother in a kitchen that is eerily identical to the one in \"Jeanne Dielman\" sitting and eating potatoes (and discussing their cooking) in the same kind of lengthy, static boring/fascinating shot. It's clear Akerman intends us to make the connection - that kind of mysterious playfulness is also often deep at the heart of her work.For a film that on some levels is a pretty straightforward and melancholy portrait of her loving, complex relationship with her mother, this is very much a challenging 'art film' on others. Shot over an indeterminate period of time, we see Natalie slowly deteriorating, death drawing ever nearer, but that is not only never discussed, but almost studiously ignored by the film-making. It's a film about death and loss where those subjects are rarely touched on, and where the whole thing starts with a 4 minute shot of a old tree in an unnamed desert being mercilessly blown by a howling wind.The location of that tree is never revealed, and it's connection to the larger story is left for the viewer to fill in. To me it represented her mother's resilience in a life where she faced much \u2013 including the Nazis, but also the kind of tough individualism that marked the lives of both mother and daughter. It also evoked Israel and seemed an ironic counterpoint to her mother's current housebound life. And last, it seemed to be issuing a challenge to watch closely, to not turn off our brains in boredom, but to transcend frustration to notice the kind of details that only come though actively looking over time, as opposed to passively watching (that challenge is another hallmark of many of Akerman's films).The film also has a deeply tragic meta aspect, We know that Natalie died during the finishing of the film and that Chantal took her life not long after. That knowledge suffuses even the most mundane moments with emotion and fascination. And as much as the film refers Akerman's earlier work in style and feel, there is also much that's new. In her earlier experiments in portraiture \u2013 whether of people or places \u2013 the lack of 'event' was always offset with the brilliant formal framing of the images. Here the camera placement feels - not saying is - totally random, often cutting off people's heads, or partially blocking the focus of the scene, as if Akerman has let go of trying to comment on life with the image, and is looking instead to capture a sense of being there in the more random way we see things in life. At times it can make the film itself feel annoyingly unfocused. But at others it brings a fresh variation to the very concept of cinema verite.This is not a film for everyone. Familiarity with, and admiration for Akerman's work certainly helps. But no question it is experimental, slow and sometimes just plain dull. On the other hand, it also touches things about the end of life \u2013 one's parent's and one's own \u2013 that are startling and sad, and couldn't be gotten to with a more familiar, comfortable and easy to digest approach.Akerman burst onto the scene as a challenging provocateur.

The Hillbilly elegy had all of the elements of an awards contender but didn't execute any of them at all in an absolute mess of a movie, lets get started.First of all, the movie had good cinematography, some interesting themes, some good chemistry between characters and great performances. The movie did look visually amazing, the set locations were excellent and well explored adding to the visual appeal of the movie. I thought some of the themes of the American dream and the prejudice of Hillbillys was well explored and expressed well the struggles of people having judgments on them before even knowing them, linking that to the main character trying to get into top end universities but being proud of his heritage was good. I thought the chemistry and the connection between the main character and Glenn Closes character, her being the motivation for JD (Gabriel Basso) for being a better person and motivating to achieve things in his life was heartwarming and powerfully thought out. I also have to have hats off to all the performances in this film because they were excellent. Gabriel Basso and Owen Asztalos were absolutely excellent as JD, they were powerful, emotional and authentic, Glenn Close and Amy Adams also did an excellent job with the poor material they were given, their performances were powerful, nuanced and hard to watch in places so they were excellent.However, my first few negatives would be the unnecessary character conflict, rushed beginning, odd narrative choices and a clunky narrative and pacing. I thought that the movie created way too much character conflict between everyone, the movie positioned each of its characters against each other, they were all bitter and horrible towards one another and it all just felt unnecessary and made the film very hard to watch due to the lack of connection to the characters. I also found the beginning very rushed, when they were establishing the character background for JD and his family I would of wanted the movie to spend more time fleshing out the characters before cutting out to modern day, I just felt like the movie didn't spend long enough developing the characters or having some form of relationship to connect with. I also found the narrative choice to switch between past and present very strange and it often didn't work for me, I got most of my connection with the characters despite it being limited when JD was younger and having it when he was older didn't work for me, this constant switch between tenses also made the narrative and pacing very clunky, it got very irritating spending a limited amount of time in the present and then cutting to the past, to the point where they were over relying on it to create character development and from a screenwriting perspective for me it was just messy and made the pacing extremely off.My next couple of negatives would be the bad character decisions and over the top melodramatic tone. I personally thought that a lot of the characters made horrible decisions throughout the movie, if the movie was supposed to make you connect with the family and reunite and be happy it managed to achieve the complete opposite, they were so horrible to each other I was genuinely questioning why they were still a family in the present, I also thought the movie had way too much of a melodramatic over the top tone, the movie had nothing positive or hardly anything uplifting whatsoever, it was all a bunch of people dieing and crying and it was just too much.My final few negatives for me would be the lack of connection to the characters or emotional connection, and the movie poorly handling its deeper themes. I had absolutely no connection to the characters whatsoever, I disliked pretty much all of them, and whenever the movie tried for a powerful and moving moment I just felt nothing and completely emotionally disconnected, my biggest issue with the movie had to the how poorly it handled the movies deeper themes, the way the movie portrayed abuse and drug addiction was almost insulting and horrible to watch, the whole movie felt completely against Amy Adams character, there wasn't one single sign of her wanting to get better, and they just portrayed her as a horrible human being, this will offend and upset a lot of people and the movie really poorly handled these themes that require a lot of thought and sensitivity to be included.Overall, the hillbilly elegy is made partly watchable to due to it's fantastic performances, but I was completely disconnected from the movie, it's script was poor and often offensive, it's pacing was all over the place and it really poorly mishandled its deeper themes which made me stop watching before the movie even ended.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Drama"}, "index_101": {"review_id": "rw5959820", "reviewer": "DoubleIndianMachete0059", "movie": "magnolia", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "A Poignant tale of Human Connection & Universal Balance", "review_date": "2 August 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "SPOILER ALERT !!!Its funny how sometimes some films touch your soul and give you an ethereal experience of a kind that becomes hard to describe. \"MAGNOLIA\" is definitely one of such kind. It is like an ocean of venerated experiences where every scene and every emotion are falling into the right place at the right time and you couldn't help but be overwhelmed. Well, I may be exagerrating but this film is one of the most profoundly influential film that i have ever seen.The story follows several charecters in a city over a course of one day, some of whom are interrelated to each other directly and some are totally unrelated but still connected by a deeper sense of similarity in their actions, desperation, anger, remorse, fate & search for love and happiness, all interlocked in a series of coincidences.This is a sad film but not the one that will make you feel empty inside but rather fills your heart with sublime emotions. One has to let go of logic to understand this film 'cause what it is trying to accomplish is far beyond the scope of logic and can only be perceived through sensibility. Moreover, this is a film about \"COINCIDENCE\" which itself doesn't follow any logic to occur. Other than that this film strongly focuses on the themes of father issues and the damages & abuses done to children and subsequently their adult life getting wrecked apart creating a sense of evarlasting bitterness and hatred in their mind. On a deeper level this is a film about one's actions in the past and its consequences that not only have its toll on the people who are affected but also on the self & that is so strong that all you left with are endless amount of pain & regret, guilt and loss. There is always an air of melancholy in the film but the great thing about the film's conscience is that even amidst all this mess there is always a silver lining because you see i think that all of them are lookin' for some kind of a closure to their grieves by trying to achieve redemption, forgiveness and happiness. And that's the beauty of Mr. Anderson's writing that at the end of the day we find our heart to sympathise for each one of them. Then there is one beautiful song by Aimee mann which was being played on the radio and figuratively piercing through the hearts of the viewers when we see all the charecters' emotions synchronizing, mouthing the same words at the same time and lamenting for what their life turned out to be, it really gets to you and makes you feel more for them. And what could have been the better way to end it other than the major unanticipated act of chance \"THE DIVINE INTERVENTION\" where Anderson blurred the line between reality and mythological event disguised in a grand act of coincidence. The idea was to bring GOD into the big picture as an awakening for the earthlings for all of their misdeeds, bitterness and absurdity and he did it beautifully.Despite the major credits going to the writing and direction, this film could have never been the same without the balanced and believable performances by all the actors. Cruise gave a memorable performance, definitely the best performance of his career, as a misogynistic pick-up artist Frank, who is at the peak of his popularity but behind this gaudiness and the smiling face there lies a tormented soul, who is constantly hiding from his past. In the scene where Frank confronted his father while simultaneously wishing that he didn't die really is one of the most challenging scene of the film but Cruise really succeeded to bring out the pathose of Frank and we couldn't help but feel his helplessness. Melora walters, who plays a drug and booze addicted Claudia, gave her charecter a broken-hearted and vulnerable image with utmost delicacy and perfection which turned out to be the most poignant performance among all. And that speech by Earl (Jason Robard) in his deathbed which ironically rang with all the other charecter's emotions, felt utmost real and aching. Along with them the remaining cast members which include Julianne moore, philip Seymour Hoffman, John.c Reilly, william.H.Macy, Philip baker Hall and others had made this film a journey to remember by giving their touching performances.This film is definitely the best out of all the other films created by Paul Thomas Anderson. His brilliant writing and his creative genius as a director has made this film a beautiful mess, the one that will remain with you forever.

Although it might seem like another prison movie with an inspiring message, The Green Mile goes far beyond ordinary. Between a remarkable cast and flawless plot, The Green Mile will have audiences on a roller-coaster of emotions from beginning to end. Tom Hanks (Paul Edgecomb), a prison guard on death row, thinks that he has seen it all until John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) is brought in. John is convicted of raping and murdering two small girls; however, there is something mysterious about John. Standing twice as tall as the guards, John appears to be capable of harming even the strongest of men, but his demeanor is kind and it throws the audience for a loop. How could a man come off as being so harmless, brutally rape and murder two innocent girls? It is obvious that Michael Clarke Duncan molded himself into John Coffey. The audience can almost feel the emotional pain that John Coffey is going through as the cell door slams shut. It is nearly impossible to imagine the extreme pain that one would go through during an electric chair execution. Not only do the viewer's get to see the execution of Arlen Bitterbuck, but also an execution gone wrong with Eduard Delacroix, played by Michael Jeter. During the execution Michael Jeter's blood curdling screams were so powerful I found myself begging for his suffering to end. The intense physical reaction to the horrific execution demonstrates that the actors clearly did their homework on how to portray their characters. Death row is where the worst of the worst criminals go, and The Green Mile found the perfect actors to make the audience experience how uncontrollable the inmates can be. Tom Hanks, along with David Morse, take control of the unstable Wild Bill Wharton, whose past adds a shocking twist to the story. The Green Mile uses the full potential of the all-star cast to make the audience feel as though they are part of the crew on death row from the beginning of the movie to the very last second. The relationship between John Coffey and Paul Edgecomb is not one that would be likely between a prison guard and an inmate. Since the moment that John is brought into death row, Paul realizes that there is something off about John and his story. Without a doubt, John could easily take down all of the guards and run free, however he doesn't. John stays calm and emits immense sorrow for the crimes he committed. While the other criminals are banging on their cells, John stays calm and pleasant with each of the guards. It isn't until Paul suffers from a painful urinary tract infection that the plot of the story takes a dramatic twist. It is hard to tell if this movie is considered part of the science fiction genre after John displays magical healing powers, helping Paul. A death row inmate going out of his way to help a sick guard? With each twist and turn of the plot in The Green Mile, the audience is thrown on a whirlwind of emotions. Throughout the first half of the movie the viewers get a taste of how frightening the life of a guilty inmate is, but what if the inmate was innocent? Not only does the plot of The Green Mile draw in the audience's emotions making them feel emotionally connected to the movie, but it also creates wonder in the minds of the audience. After watching the movie, I found myself thinking about what I would do if I were an innocent inmate. Never before have I felt as engaged in a film as I did with The Green Mile. It is truly a roller-coaster from start to finish with an ending that changed how I view society and the justice system. The Green Mile is absolutely a must see movie for all who are looking for a movie that will leave them guessing up until the very last moment. There is not another film that could come close to the impact that The Green Mile has on its viewers. Between a remarkable cast who made the audience believe they were part of the film, and a plot that has unexpected twists, The Green Mile deserves the highest rating and a wide range of awards.", "publish_date": "1999", "category": "Crime,Drama,Fantasy"}, "index_103": {"review_id": "rw3456303", "reviewer": "Yelitza-screenwriting-student", "movie": "criminal", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "From criminal to hero: A journey of redemption", "review_date": "22 April 2016", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Please watch this film!! Give it a go! I'm watching it a few times.1. The wonderful: Lots of suspense and thrill! What a journey of redemption! How entertaining and intriguing!! As Jericoh (Kevin Costner) progressively gets more involved with Pope's sentimental memories (feelings of love and kindness), he also develops a sensitivity for humanity: he develops positive emotions. And of course we empathize with JEricoh when we learn the cause of his brain damage--his father throws him off the window of a running car...this marked him forever. I also love how Pope's wife (Gadot) connects with this \"criminal,\" because he carries her deceased beloved husbands memories and feelings. Likewise, Pope's daughter bonds with Jericoh. And the emotional climax of the movie is my favorite part! It's a moment of truth and tears. Another thing I liked was the Russian hacker (Michael Pitt) that have taken control of nuclear missiles system--in the end, he sabotages the system and prevents the wicked Spaniard (Molla, the real villain of the film) to carry out destruction. The science-fiction portion of the story is such an mind-opener! Can people with no ability to distinguish between good and evil be saved? What if they are exposed to the neural pathways/memories of goodness, of kindness? What if they experience these positive emotions and can then make a choice? This is what Jericoh does. He doesn't automatically turns good, he makes the choice to turn good, because he discovers something he has never experience before, thanks to Pope's memories. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when he tells Gadot he couldn't ever harm her because Pope would never do so. After that moment, Gadot overcomes her fear. Pope's goodness has reflected on Jericoh, and Jericoh has accepted that. I also love Tommy Lee Jones as Dr. Frank! Just love him. AND THE ENDING? Fantastic! I wanted to stay in that moment forever! A shining Kevin Costner.2. The ugly and terrible: Seeing Kevin Costner commit such heinous acts of violence without a trace of emotion in his face is hard to watch. Of course his brain is impervious to emotion or the sense of good vs. evil. Hence that's why he becomes the perfect target for Dr. Frank's experiment. But it's Kevin Costner! Our sweetheart wonderful good-guy actor. Also, Pope(Reynolds) suffers a brutal death...that's hard to watch (or hear).3. What I ponder about: Lots of layers, lots of elements going on. But the whole idea of this Spaniard anarchist having such level of power. He doesn't operate on a global scale or doesn't seem strong enough to have such impact.Overall, this is a film with a positive message. I walked out of the theater feeling good!

It's a coming of age tale with heart, it's got a great soundtrack, and some pretty good performances. However, rather than telling a properly compelling story, Sing Street often feels a little too preoccupied with portraying its time period. It undoubtedly paints a picture of mid-80s pop culture very well, but that's at the expense of a genuinely engrossing story, making this seem like a little too much style over substance.Directed and written by John Carney, who also made Once (which I didn't like) and Begin Again (which I loved), Sing Street is a bit of a middling film of his. As we've seen in his other films, there's always a real passion for making music, and how it can bring people together, and that does feature once again here.Time and time again, we get some great original songs mixed with classics of the 80s, and that's one of the things that makes this an enjoyable watch. It's a toe-tapper of a film, and, particularly if you have a strong nostalgia for the time period, you'll love seeing it portrayed on screen so well.However, unlike Begin Again, which weaved that music in with an engrossing and emotional story, Sing Street suffers from a very thin story, and pretty plain characters, which means that it's never as emotionally resonant as it needs to, and clearly wants to be.There were numerous moments where the story takes a step back from the fun of making a band and singing songs, and tries to look at the various problems in the characters' lives in order to get you to connect with them more. However, seeing as none of the characters really stand out from one another, and all just feel like very generic coming-of-age movie teenagers, it was a lot harder for me to care about whatever was happening in their personal lives, which meant that any time when the film tried to be more emotional, it really fell flat.And this is where I'm going to bring in a comparison to The Commitments, which was clearly a big influence on this film. They both have great music, and they've both got a great sense of fun about them, but the major difference is the characters. In The Commitments, the varied personalities gave the film a great dynamic, and also meant that you could care about each individual person on screen, whereas in Sing Street, considering that we don't have that, it loses a huge amount of its power, and makes the majority of the story feel very thin.The characters may be thin, and that does impact on your interest, but the performances are still very good. Although they may not have so much to do, young actors including Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor and especially Lucy Boynton really do shine, and do very well to keep you entertained and engaged by what is in truth a bit of an average and generic story.Overall, I liked Sing Street.

Its story, however, feels very thin, and that means that it's never as emotionally effective or interesting as it should have been.", "publish_date": "2016", "category": "Comedy,Drama,Music"}, "index_105": {"review_id": "rw6450662", "reviewer": "SiavashM357", "movie": "tenet", "rating": "3", "review_summary": "Unintentional Self-parody", "review_date": "7 January 2021", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Possible Spoilers AheadFirst of all, I completely understand the plot and themes. Actually the story is not that complicated or even confusing, it's just a messy narrative and also you can't hear anything; more on that later.Highly dynamic mixing of sounds and loud emotional music, worked great in Interstellar, why? Because Interstellar is a pretty emotional and simple story and half of the time, if you don't hear something, it's actually okay; the picture is crystal clear. But they essentially did the same thing with Tenet, and it's terrible for this film because it's mostly an action/pseudo-logical movie, not an emotional one. Just because something worked in one of your movies, doesn't mean it will work every time, for a different movie.More often than not, the music is surprisingly irrelevant to the movie and it's annoyingly present all the way through; again, this is not Interstellar. The Music is not bad, it's actually good music, but the continual presence of mostly intense music, makes the movie feel really cheap and boring, it's like they wanted it to be exciting all the time which we all know, it's a terrible plan; you need good dialogue, characters, competent writing and decent scenes to be exciting, not an everlasting irrelevant soundtrack on every scene and specially the scenes that should be emotionally tense or even quiet to have their effect.Almost all the characters are Deus ex machina, there's no reason for any of them to be there; they're there to advance the plot and this is done in a very obvious and lifeless manner. Because of this, there is almost no tension whatsoever. Also the characters don't feel real; they have no story or motivation, you don't connect with them, they don't even have names (he's literally called the protagonist). All in all, you feel nothing towards them, so there is zero tension in any of the action scenes.The villain is hilariously unbelievable, it's like he's from a cartoon from the 60s. When this clich\u00e9d Russian oligarch shouts, it's just unintentionally humorous; it has no tension or weight. I burst out laughing when he said \"Vengeful b---h! Living off me!\" And this happens multiple times in the movie. What is the goal in scenes like this? The writing is humorously tasteless, the music and sound design is horrible in these scenes, acting is rudimentary, and even the blocking is ghastly; especially that specific scene feels like a soap opera with expensive equipment.There is some degree of triteness in the film, like really bad one-liners (\"one man's whatever\" or \"if I can't have you, no one else can\", \"Because anger scars over into despair\", etc.) These cheesy lines do not belong to this movie, and the delivery just makes them worse. At some point someone says \"Don't do this, this will ruin everything\" and then the character goes ahead and does exactly that (which reminded me of low quality comedies) with no consequences whatsoever.There are some scenes in the movie that could be removed completely and nothing will change. Like the intro is a complete waste of time and has nothing to do with the movie. Or the scene that they go to that apartment, just to find out that the guy is not important and the lady is with them. The inversion concept seems cool at first, but they don't actually develop it, and if you think about it a little; you'd see hundreds of glaring errors and plot holes that it just becomes absurd and not in a good way.I think unconsciously, they mixed the music and sound effects so loud, because it's pretty embarrassing if you hear the actual dialogues in this movie.I give it a 3 out of 10, just because it has some nice action scenes and practical effects, which from a technical standpoint, this is the highlight of the movie.\nEverything else?

The film did get a really bad reception from critics and whilst I don't think it's a terrible film, it's one that I don't think is very good either.Hillbilly Elegy follows J.D. Vance, a Yale law student, who returns to his hometown after receiving an urgent phone call where he reflects on his Appalachian family and future.Ron Howard has made movies in the past that I have enjoyed and seeing two amazing actresses like Glenn Close and Amy Adams in a movie like this made me believe they were finally gonna get their overdue Oscars but sadly that might not happen. Glenn Close still may have a chance since she did a great job in the film itself and it's surprising to see how closely she resembled J.D. Vance's real grandmother. I've always loved Amy Adams and she also does a decent job in this film even though there were times where I thought she was a bit overdramatic.The real problem I have was the way the story was handled. There is a lot that happens over the course of the film but it didn't make me feel much. The story had so much potential to flesh out the characters and create some very powerful moments that would've made me emotional but that wasn't the case. The screenplay by Vanessa Taylor is pretty weak and doesn't feel honest. I understood J.D. Vance's perspective but the character seemed quite bland to me. Gabriel Basso was fine but there wasn't much to him. Young J.D. Vance played by Owen Asztalos had more to work with compared to Basso but the screenplay and editing hindered me from fully connecting with him. Taylor's treatment of the other characters appeared one dimensional to me. I felt there was so much more to Bev and the troubles she dealt with but the film doesn't explore it to a greater extent. The film does have a few scenes that are meant to evoke emotion but the editing doesn't allow that emotion to flow. The use of slow motion and choice of cuts did ruin the emotional feeling I was meant to feel during the more dramatic scenes.Overall, Hillbilly Elegy is just another forgettable Oscar bait movie. The acting from Close and Adams keep it afloat but the treatment of the story doesn't work in the film's favour.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Drama"}, "index_107": {"review_id": "rw6192054", "reviewer": "davidmvining", "movie": "the new world", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "Beautiful and crushing", "review_date": "20 October 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "For about the last thirty minutes of Terrence Malick's The New World, I'm a mess. The emotional connection that Malick creates between me, the audience, and his characters is so complete that the final emotional motions that the princess Pocahontas goes through as she finishes out her story affect me at levels I find very rare in film. On top of that, the production is so intricate, the editing so evocative, and the performances so restrained but emotional that I find the mass audience resistance to The New World both completely flabbergasting and entirely understandable. This is an art film, for sure, but it works just so very well.This movie is about the story of Pocahontas and John Smith much the same way that The Thin Red Line is about the Battle of Guadalcanal. In other words, not really. Yes, Pocahontas is the main character, John Smith and John Rolfe play large supporting roles, and we witness the early clash of civilizations around the founding and formative years of Jamestown, but they're window dressing to the actual story Terrence Malick was trying to tell which is about the loss of innocence, or, to put it in an idiom that more closely aligns with his overall thematic obsessions, it's about the expulsion from paradise, from Eden.I've read critiques, intelligent critiques, mind you, of The New World that talk about how Malick over-idealizes the natives, or the naturals as the English call them in the film, of 1607 Virginia, but I feel like that's missing the point. There's a larger thematic point about the effervescent nature of utopia on Earth, but there's also a character point. When John Smith is allowed to live by his native captors, he's put in the hands of Pocahontas, a fourteen year old girl who sees nothing around her but nature, which she calls Mother, in all its glory. She's almost a sprite in a certain way where she moves with the wind and the water around her. She acts as Smith's translator and view into the world of the natives, and because his lens is built a certain way he fails to see the more realistic side of the naturals.There's a moment as Smith is brought into the longhouse, ready for judgment and death, when, in the corner of the frame, a warrior handles a human hand cut from its arm. We also see other examples of the natives desiring possessions like a copper kettle that conflicts with his voiceover statements while he was in his own personal Eden when he said that they had no sense of possession. His sense of utopia is built on perception, but like the treehouse in Badlands or the village in The Thin Red Line, this utopia is of the world and contains the seeds of its own destruction.So, the English arrive in Virginia and set up a colony, and we can see the normal progression of plot familiar to the Pocahontas story. Smith gets captured and saved. The English nearly starve in the winter. Pocahontas brings them food to keep them from starving. Smith goes away, Rolfe shows up, Rolfe and Pocahontas marry, and they go to England where Pocahontas dies. The movie isn't that terribly interested in the details of the stories on their own. Every event is used as a vehicle for Malick's thematic ideas as carried through by his characters. We don't need films to act as our history textbooks, so Malick using the Pocahontas story to explore his own ideas is a wonderful fit.One of the interesting things about the film's structure is that up until a little over the halfway point, John Smith is by far the most central of characters. We mostly see Pocahontas through his eyes, getting smaller moments away from him for her here and there, but it makes sense when you see what Malick is trying to do. Smith is the one who discovers and experiences that new innocence and paradise on Earth when he arrives in America. He loses it before Pocahontas does, and when he's called away by the king to look for a north passage to the Indies, it's her turn to feel like everything is lost.Not only has Pocahontas been cast out from her tribe, but now she's left along among strangers with strange ways in a place that had been her home but now no longer looks like it. Instead of the forest, she lives in a house. When she receives the false information that Smith has died, she has literally nothing left. Her entire world has been taken from her. What does she end up doing? She ends up moving forward. She gets a servant woman, Mary, who helps her learn how to read and write. John Rolfe appears and courts her to the point of marriage. She rebuilds as a new woman in a new world. The first time she smiles and chases after some flying insects on her tobacco farm with Rolfe, it's a marvelous moment. She feels like she's finally becoming alive again.The final section of the film deals with Pocahontas going to England with Rolfe and their son. It's here that the movie fully embraces the idea of the new world, especially in how we also follow Opechancanough who goes to count the white men and find this God that the English are always talking about. The wilds of America were beautiful and untamed, but the gardens and cathedrals of England contain their own awe inspiring beauty for the newly arrived man. It's also here that Pocahontas, now called Rebecca, meets John Smith again, and this heartbreaking scene is the core of the film.Smith still clings to the paradise he knew with her years before, but she finds that she's become detached from the same place. Smith has nothing else, feeling like he's talking to her for the first time, but Pocahontas is able to see beyond it, beyond the dream. She has a loving husband and a small son, both of whom are very real and very present, and that's what she can cling to. She has something real, but all Smith has is a dream. And even then, Malick gives us her final spiritual moments as she dances around a rich English country estate in her full gown as though she were just the same sprite from the beginning. She's still the same woman, but fuller now that she's found something real to cling onto.When I first started writing about movies on the Internet, I formalized my thinking on how all stories are built. They consist of four major elements: character, plot, style, and theme. Every story has all four in different amounts, and every audience member has a preference, though they may not be able to vocalize it this way. Malick's films are heavily stylized, for sure, but they have very firm foundations in character and theme. Plot is incidental to his moviemaking, but for many, I think most, filmgoers, plot is the single most important element of storytelling to them. When they encounter a film that has no plot, they think there's no story or that nothing's happening, and they disengage. I find this unfortunate because someone like Malick is telling stories, just in a different way than many people expect. Opening up to someone like Malick can lead to rapturous experiences like every time I watch The New World. Malick may have a process that almost no one else can get their minds around (stories of Malick pissing off actors, directors of photography, and even composers are kind of the stuff of legend), but his end products show an artist in full command of his art, even if his methods are far from traditional.The New World is a work of art. It's one of my favorite films. It hits me emotionally like very few films can. It is the work of a visionary and a genius. I adore this film.", "publish_date": "2005", "category": "Biography,Drama,History"}, "index_108": {"review_id": "rw2976145", "reviewer": "loveandthunderstorms", "movie": "nymphomaniac: vol. i", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "Psychology, Not Sex", "review_date": "8 March 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "I rarely write IMDb movie reviews but I felt compelled to do so with Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac Part I after seeing the countless reviews and message board posts proclaiming this film to be \"porn\". This film is graphic but it is not porn. I would say that anyone who has ever suffered emotionally, struggled with apathy and/or resigned themselves to risky behaviors as a result of their emotional struggles will find a deeper understanding of this film, elevating it far beyond pornography. This is a review examining the story and psychology of the film, rather than a focal point on graphic sex. To focus only on its graphic nature would be to miss the point of the film entirely.Nymphomaniac Parts I and II comprise the third act of Von Trier's \"Depression Trilogy\". The other two films being Melancholia and Antichrist. This \"trilogy\" came about as a result of his own experience with a major depressive episode and the psychological insights he gained of the depressed psyche. Nymphomania (or excessive sexual drive) is a legitimate psychological disorder that is recognized by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) of the World Health Organization. Sufferers are often apathetic, their behaviors reckless and impetuous with little regard for consequences. The film begins with the protagonist Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg), beaten and abandoned in a rainy alley where she is found and subsequently taken in by Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard) after refusing medical help. Seligman is a kind man who offers her food, clean clothes and a place to rest. They begin a conversation and Joe begins to tell Seligman her story, beginning with her childhood. Their dialogue is interspersed with flashback scenes of a young Joe (Stacy Martin), following her from childhood to young adulthood.I'll cut to the chase. Much has been made of the nudity and graphic sex in this film. Is it necessary? Yes, I believe it to be. Joe's mix of self hatred and indifference are conveyed in her many emotionless encounters with various men. The encounters are straightforward and at times, mechanical. One can easily deduce that these are not encounters of passion but rather, compulsiveness. This is not a film that aims to portray Joe as a victim, nor the men as predators (and vice versa). That would be far below Von Trier's abilities as a writer/director and too simple of a concept for a character as tumultuous as Joe. Rather, I feel he aims to bring us into the life and psyche of Joe, illustrate the desperation, compulsivity and dispassionate nature that began dominating Joe's life from a very early age. Compulsive hypersexual behaviors actually have very little to do with the sex itself, so some of the usual dynamics of sexual relations between two people (joy, jealousy, euphoria, power struggles, etc.) do not come into play here. At least, not for Joe anyway.Despite such a bleak interpretation of sex in this woman's life, the material is handled with care. Some scenes are extremely graphic and shocking in its content and intent but the way in which it's handled contains a certain level of sensitivity. Joe is reckless and callous but Von Trier doesn't shame her in his interpretation. That's not to say that things do not get intense later on in Part II.I found the film to be beautifully shot, the dialogue well written, almost poetic at times. Gainsbourg and Skarsgard are mesmerizing in their scenes together and Stacy Martin gives a solid and subtle performance as the young Joe. I was not pleased with the casting of Shia LaBeouf as Joe's first sexual encounter and Christian Slater as Joe's father. Neither of them were very good at affecting a British accent, nor did they transform at all in their prospective roles. I merely saw them both doing what they normally do, just dialed down a little bit so as not to disrupt the flow of the film. Unfortunately, any scene involving either one of them completely took me out of the film. Despite this, I still found myself very affected by the film overall. By the time I had neared the end, the final scene that held so much promise of hope and emotional connection for Joe was rendered heartbreaking with her exclamation that she couldn't \"feel anything\". I found this moment to be especially wrenching. After watching Joe naively explore her compulsions, one could feel a slight amount of tension building and more than once, I wondered, \"the other shoe has to fall at some point\". With Joe's pain filled cries of \"I can't feel anything\" (her first display of intense emotion), one senses that this is the point at which things take a sad and dark turn and a perfect point to end Part I before embarking on the consequences and even darker and more disturbing elements contained in Part II.There are those that will continue to tout this film as \"pornography\". I suppose the best analogy I have for those who just can't see past the graphic sex would be to compare Joe's sexual compulsions with the compulsions of a drug addict, one difference being that drug addiction is a widely seen, accepted, understood, discussed and examined issue. Hypersexual disorders and behaviors are not, unfortunately. However, being able to identify with certain behaviors at the exclusion of others would be a rather narrow minded approach. How many of you have had a bad day, been fired, been broken up with and decided to go out and get rip roaring drunk, incredibly high or rebound with a stranger in order to deal with the disappointment? You know better, you know it isn't the best idea, you know there will be consequences but you do it anyway. Now imagine the same scenario except there's no inner monologue, no weighing of options.

Avengers 2.5 is a politically-charged superhero movie that will catch you off guard and provide you with a mostly non-cartoonish plot filled with well-developed conflict and character development. Witness some of your favorite Marvel superheroes secede from the Avengers and oppose those who they once fought side-by-side. Along the way, you also get to meet some new additions to the team that will provide some awkward comedic sequences in this otherwise serious movie. Deep dark secrets come to the surface that threaten the very possibility of the team ever having any hope of reunification. Captain America: Civil War is a brilliantly produced film that will have even those who typically do not care for most superhero films leaving the theatre satisfied and anticipating the next installment in the series. Although it is really an Avengers movie, there is still enough focus on the title character to support the choice of titles for this action-packed epic adventure.It isn't often that a genre typically filled with high concept, shallow plots can surprise you with a narrative radiating with anthropological and political themes and subtext. The brilliance of Captain America: Civil War is that it provides the audience with equal parts action-packed fight choreography and well-developed dramatic plot with prolific amounts of character conflict. Furthermore, the story will exceed your expectations of the ability to tap into one's superficial response to action-packed stimuli and activate the deeper emotions of allegiance, betrayal, and self-preservation. For those who have not seen the previous movies in the Captain America series\u2013 another admirable element of this installment, is not causing those who have yet to watch the previous CA movies to feel left out of the excitement. Provided you have seen the preceding Avengers movies, this one will keep you trekking along with your favorite Avengers universe characters. There are certainly minor elements or past relationships that are introduced in the previous CA movies, but most likely you will be able to pick up on the aforementioned as you watch Civil War.Another observation of this installment in the Captain America/Avengers franchises respectfully, is the movie's success in both including current characters and introducing new ones without the film ever feeling too crowded, as it was with Batman v Superman. In addition to the Avengers minus Hulk and Thor, the audience is introduced to an adolescent Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and are re- acquainted with Ant Man (Paul Rudd). As I am not familiar with the comics, I cannot comment on this Spider-Man in respect to staying true to the comic, but I found this incarnation of Spider-Man to be on the verge of annoying. Perhaps that is how he is suppose to be, but it did not fit in with how he has been historically portrayed in cartoons and movies. However, the inclusion of both the respective characters did not feel forced as it so easily could have. Since the film primarily focused on Captain America and secondly Iron Man, the large cast of characters was handled efficiently. The writers could include all these characters in one narrative, but shift the focus from character or character thus never overstimulating or overwhelming the audience with the development of such a dynamic ensemble cast.Ordinarily, I do not speak so highly of superhero movies; but this film left me feeling quite satisfied and pleased with how well the film played off as a serious movie complete with plenty of opportunity for emotional connections. That being said, the one sequence of the movie that I did not find as entertaining or fitting is the elaborate \"civil war\" battle on the tarmac. Was it choreographed well? Yes. Was it instrumental in moving the plot forward? Yes. Did it effectively fit in with the rest of the mood and pacing of the film? No. Moreover, that entire sequence of scenes just felt awkward. And, that is mostly due to the inclusion of the naivety and immaturity of Spider- Man and witty/sarcastic/near-juvenile antics of Ant Man. Perhaps if only one adolescent-like character had been added, that part of the film would not have felt so awkward. As to not give away the reasons for the solemn mood of the film, I cannot go into much detail; but, the manner which this scene was written and directed just felt out of place and interrupted the otherwise excellent pacing and mood of the story. I agree that most serious movies need comedic relief in order to generate an emotional roller-coaster, but this was just a little too funny with respect to the rest of the film.The summer blockbuster season is officially underway with the undoubtedly successful opening weekend of Captain America: Civil War aka Avengers 2.5. Unlike last year's Avengers: Age of Ultron, this installment will take you on fantastic journey of emotional mountains and valleys of character and plot development. This film proves that a superhero movie can be both fantastically action-packed and dramatic. The political subtext will also provide friends and family countless hours of discussion and analysis. Although this is not an adult superhero movie in the way Deadpool was, there is still language and violence that may not be appropriate for young kids. Still, one of the earmarks of a summer blockbuster is a movie that can attract and please both teens and adults, and this is definitely a great example. Hopefully, this movie is an indicator of an exhilarating summer season at the cinema.", "publish_date": "2016", "category": "Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi"}, "index_110": {"review_id": "rw6192056", "reviewer": "davidmvining", "movie": "the tree of life", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "A work of staggering vision and genius", "review_date": "20 October 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "The intensely personal The Tree of Life recounts a childhood much like one that Terrence Malick led. One of three brothers, one of whom died at nineteen, Malick was raised in Waco, Texas in the 1950s where his father was a geologist for an oil company and played organ for their church. All of these details are present in Malick's fifth movie where he also presents an extended sequence about the creation of the cosmos, life, and the conscience. It's also the third absolute masterpiece Malick made...in a row.This is Malick's movie that most plays loose with time, jumping back and forth from the present day to the fifties to the sixties and then deep into pre-history when the stars were young. It's a feature length near experiment, but it manages a shocking cohesiveness because Malick understands exactly the story he wants to tell. The quote from Job that starts the film (\"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\") is one of the keys to figuring out what Malick is doing, and he presents it to his audience at the very beginning.It's not that the story is a retelling of the story of Job, though it does often feel like an intersection of Job with Cain and Abel, but that the question that Malick feels Job addresses gets addressed in his story. I would distill it down to the idea that we all have limits on what we can control and that, despite our own behaviors and morals, there are forces outside of us that exert control over our lives. It's a humbling experience for anyone who lives through it, and every major character goes through this realization by the end. In order to paint the picture of this idea, Malick has created a story rife with a series of motifs that he's become known for, including one in particular that he brings to the fore more than ever before.The idea of the Eden on Earth is apparent here, but more complexly drawn than in any other form. The entire memory of Jack, the main character, from his childhood is a kind of Eden, but it's a place of pain and anger in addition to a place of joy and freedom. This was never completely outside of Malick's previous versions of paradise on Earth that could never truly be because of our fallen nature, but its fallen state is more apparent in the personifications of two forces in the world, Nature and Grace. Looking back over Malick's filmography up to this point, you can point out this burgeoning idea in dichotomies like the Farmer and Bill in Days of Heaven or the contrast between Staros and Tall in The Thin Red Line, but it's through Mrs. O'Brien and Mr. O'Brien, Jack's parents, that the embodiment of the dual idea comes to its fullest fruition.Mother is Grace, almost sprite-like. As played by Jessica Chastain, she seems to float through Jack's memory on a light breeze (even bounding up by the eponymous Tree at one point in his vision), offering comfort and succor in contrast to Father. Father, as Nature, is a hard man. I wouldn't call him cruel by any measure, but he's exacting and demands that his rule is law. When he says that R.L., Jack's first younger brother, should stay silent at the table, he expect that order to be followed, and when R.L., in a moment of daring, tells his father to shut up instead, he lashes out physically. There's no actual abuse, but his hardness comes out in violent grabs and reaches that never quite make their mark despite some of his best efforts. That dinner fight is one of the central battlegrounds of the boys souls in the film, and the quiet fight that erupts between Mother and Father afterwards is emblematic of the touch equilibrium that Nature and Grace have to find in life.In the middle of all of this is Jack. In a literal breakdown of the action, the movie is a memory of middle-aged Jack after he had had a tough worded conversation with his father that had something to do with the death of R.L. when he was nineteen, decades before. In his tower of glass from where he works as an architect, he ponders the life he had left behind years ago in Waco. He wonders what his mother might have thought at the death of her son, very likely her favorite as evidenced by both parents' obvious affection for R.L. that they never seem to demonstrate for either Jack or for Steve, the youngest. The bulk of the film is a revisitation of his memories through the beginning of his maturity, when he learns the limitations of his own experience, his parents' knowledge and power, and ultimately his own sense of guilt for what he did as a child.Like most children, Jack ends up rebelling against his parents. Manifested by throwing rocks through windows with his friends and even sneaking into an unlocked house of an attractive woman down the street to dig through her things and steal a slip, Jack can't operate under the iron hand of his father anymore and acts out. However, he's still a good boy at heart. He can't keep the slip, hiding it under some logs before letting it go down the river. He embraces his father at a moment of weakness as his father lightly berates him for the care of the lawn. Even though he even goes so far as to assert that his father wants him dead to his face, Jack can't hold onto that sense for too long, his father's own pain eventually becoming apparent to an increasingly adult Jack.This is a complex story of complex emotions as told through children, and near the beginning of it all is the creation of the Cosmos sequence, one of the boldest and most emotionally engaging acts of pure awe in film. It's precipitated by Jack's pondering on what his mother would have thought at the death of R.L. and her questioning of God's will at the death of such a good, young man. Pointing back to that quote from Job that starts the film, it's Malick cinematically offering the answer that God gave to Job. Instead of the words about where was Job when God was creating the heavens and the earth, we watch the heavens and the earth form. We watch life birth from nothing. We even get the first conscious decisions of pity by watching a pair of dinosaurs. It's a remarkably humbling moment as we watch and listen to one mother's very painful questioning to get a sense of our own scale in the universe as a whole. It is our limitations that end up scaring us, and that's what ends up playing out in the film as a whole. Jack's limitations are of childhood. Mother's are of faith. Father's are more practical in nature and arise from his job and efforts to raise his children into men.Through all of this are fantastic performances, especially from the children. One of the advantages of Terrence Malick's production style is that he's extremely adaptive and improvisational to the point that he's not looking for actors to manufacture realistic moments. Instead, he's trying to capture real moments with people who get lost in who they are playing. This is born from several things, not the least is the fantastic production design from Jack Fisk (who had done the production design on every Malick film starting with Badlands) which allow the actors to completely immerse themselves in the tangible reality of their worlds. It also comes from the improvisation which allows actors, including the children, to find moments, as disconnected as they may be individually, to create a cohesive emotional reality from which to operate. So, Hunter McCracken, as the young Jack, along with Laramie Eppler as R.L. and Tye Sheridan as Steve are allowed moments to be boys together, to be afraid of Brad Pitt as their father together, and to connect with Jennifer Chastain as Mother together. There's never a false moment from a single actor in this film, and considering that the film stars children, that's actually rather remarkable.Terrence Malick is a genius. He understands the cinematic power of image and sound better than almost any other working director and most who have passed. He attacks his central questions from all angles, and never the one you might expect. He creates believable physical realities for his characters to explore and pursue his thematic obsessions. He has an incredibly distinctive cinematic voice, approaching large questions with intelligence and tenderness, while filling the frame with beautiful images that never feel staged or artificial. The Tree of Life is the third movie in a row from Malick that fills me with emotions that few movies even try to accomplish.

Yes, Roland Jaff\u00e9's \"Killing Fields\" is a wonderful story of \"professionalism, friendship and courage\", showing the true dedication of two professional journalists in their attempt to cover the on-going chaos in Cambodia at the Vietnam War's aftermath and their mutual support in the midst of a nation implosion announcing the worst. Naturally their collaboration produces the kind of fraternal bonds that can only bloom in worst-case situations, which is exactly what Cambodia is going through.The two reporters are Sidney Schanberg from the New York Times (Sam Waterston) and his Cambodian interpret and photographer Dith Pran (Dr. Haing S Ngor). Both had the courage to face every obstacle getting in their way to truth and each one tries to save the other's life at some point. That Sidney fails to get Dith his ticket to New York thus exposing him to the brutality (and that's an understatement) of the Khmer Rouge Army is profoundly affecting but never to the point that we blame him, we know he did his best. And so did his fellow co-workers, among them the photographer played by John Malkovich and whose efforts to get the right picture for a fake passport result in one of the film's most suspenseful sequences, one that goes without a single aimed weapon.But beyond the \"friendship, professional, courage\" tryptic, what the film accomplishes goes beyond its narrative format. It's perhaps the most notorious and vivid depictions of one of the worst atrocities of the last fifty years: the Khmer Rouge genocide. In a short lapse of time, about two millions of Cambodians were sacrificed at the altar of a 'Cultural' Revolution that annihilated every remain of civilization. Between 1975 and 1979, through starvations, exploitation and mass executions, the Army of the New Order enslaved a whole population, brainwashed the younger ones, cutting their family ties to produce a generation of zealous teenagers who wouldn't hesitate to pull a trigger. They also got rid of any citizen who represents a connection with the Old Order: doctors, engineers, intellectuals, as a matter of fact, wearing glasses could sign your death warrant. And so either you played dumb and resigned yourself to years of labour and hunger in Labour Camps or you were dead.A few survived the horror, I wouldn't spoil the fate of Dith Pran but if you read this review, I invite you to google the name of Dr. Haing S Ngor who played him. He too was a genocide surviror and a spokesperson for the Cambodian community until his untimely assassination in 1996. His death was classified as murder but the shady circumstances make it rather hard to believe that there was no connection whatsoever with Pol Pot (who was still alive at that time). Anyway, Ngor's death shows that \"The Killing Fields\" is more than a film, it's a testimony rooted in the past like a tree but whose branches were still growing, trying to reach, if not the peace, but the realization of the Occidental world. Because to add up to the misery, no one really cared about the tragedy and the world left thousands of innocents dying behind closed doors.It's even worse when you see in the film's early scenes a miscalculated American bombing destroying killing civilians. So the film is about the Free World's total indifference or in the best case, impotence. And I guess it's only fair that its most inspirational triumph (the film was in AFI's Top Cheers) didn't rely on a White Savior trope. Many great stories were built on that, \"Schindler's List\" is an example but \"The Killing Fields\" couldn't afford such a straightforward resolution. But it's still effective as a war movie, because what it does is portraying real people, played by not glamorous actors, some were relatively unknown at the time. Many scenes showing the Cambodian guerrilla, the arrests, the bombings or the random executions are shot in a way that channels \"The Battles of Algiers\" which impressed director Jaff\u00e9. But Jaff\u00e9 also knows when to use synthesized music to enhance the emotional power or the thrills of one scene.Still, it's for these moments of fragile humanity that the film deserves our attention, the friendship between Dith and Sidney, their sweetness, their vulnerability, their fears and smiles. It's also for these little foretastes on the terror before the titular fields reveal the ugly secrets buried in their muddy holes, for these brief moments showing a little child crying in the middle of an intense bombing or the emotional farewell to Dith that the film is such an extraordinary journey, culminating with a tale of survival-b-keeping-a-low-profile that makes it closer to \"The Pianist\" than \"Schindler's List\".But there's little chance that this film has been watched as many times as these WW2 classics even with its status as a Best Picture nominee. A real shame because the 100th entry of the British Film Institute Top 100 should be exposed to the public eyes, to raise awareness of a tragedy as emotionally devastating as the Holocaust, if only because this time it was a Genocide of a regime against their own people. \"The Killing Fields\" is important film-making, it's a historical document that I recommend watching in the company of several Youtube clips that would provide further insights on the tragedy.Roland Jaff\u00e9 would later make \"The Mission\", an interesting companion piece. Not to venture into hazardous comparaisons, but I guess what both films show is that men's evil might annihilate one civilization but not the universal extent of fraternal love ... immortalized by the film's emotional finale before closing on a picture of two child refugees, one looking behind, one helplessly staring at us... what a symbol!", "publish_date": "1984", "category": "Biography,Drama,History"}, "index_112": {"review_id": "rw2974334", "reviewer": "gameplacereviews", "movie": "cloud atlas", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "6 stories spanning hundreds of years Cloud Atlas is an amazing epic.", "review_date": "5 March 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Cloud Atlas Director: Lana Wachowski, Andy Watchowski, Tom Tykwer. Actors: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving...Watch Cloud Atlas; I think that this is the most touching, thrilling, and gut wrenching film I have seen in a while. The thing is, you will connect to this movie, and the emotion from it is immense. I am still feeling the emotional resonance of the film a day after I watched it. It spreads six stories, all good in their own way, and features so many genres. It is a romance, action, sci-fi, murder mystery and comedy all at the same time. The point of it is to show you that everyone and everything is connected in some small way or another. The six stories are all incredible in their own way. But there are a few that fare better than others. The Somni-451 sci-fi story and the dystopian alien story were the best in my opinion. The other stories are great but these stood out so well. The Somni-451 section is full of emotion and has a one of the most gut-wrenching twists I've ever seen. And the acting. There are a bunch of actors playing multiple roles and still hitting all out of the ballpark. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving. All of them are good. The directing for a movie like this is spectacular. It must be hard for the directors to have to switch genres for almost every part of the movie, but it is executed so well. Then there is the effects. While this film is very much a marvel of storytelling as it balances the stories quite well, it is even more of a master of the visual aspect. This is the Wachowski's, makers of The Matrix, contribution. Of course the effects are top notch. They really are. In the science fiction future story especially, the effects are amazing. In the 1970's one there is still a good amount of flair. The thing is that this movie has a visual flair to it. It is a colorful film that handles it's effects well. Also good is the action. Whenever the action is going on it is simple but thrilling. Actually I must say that this has to be one of the most thrilling films I've ever seen, and it means so much to me.The costumes and the cinematography are incredible as well. The future looks slick and beautiful, the 70's seem closer to home. The way the camera weaves itself around the scenes and the action. Lastly I want you to know that this movie evokes emotion a lot of it. I cried at the end of it. That was mainly because I was so caught up in the awesomeness.

This film is very well done and is very deserving of it's accolades, in it's screenplay in particular.The Descendants is written by Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. This is both Faxon and Rash's first film. This film is very well written with a plot that doesn't lose too much focus on the main issues, which is sometimes found with comedic drama films like this, and the writers have written great dialogue that is believable and not too overly sentimental. The films maintains it's comedic tones through the dialogue from both Clooney, Woodley, and Krause. There are moments where the film feels heartbreaking but there are also times where you end up chuckling at a line for at least a minute as it either came out of nowhere or it just felt so real that it's funny. If a film is able to make me laugh and feel saddened, that is something I am very inclined to revisit in the future.Alexander Payne directed this film and I came into this with no expectations as this is my first experience with the director. There are a few films from Payne's catalogue that I definitely want to see. Payne's handling with this film is definitely excellent. The way he handles this story, which if handled by a different director can be emotional and overly depressing, is very effective. Payne decided to keep the film's tone positive and at times comedic. This decision helps keep the film light and and have the audience come out of it feeling good and satisfied. The film's positive tone is due to the photography, dialogue and the score of the film.The film's photography was handled by Phedon Papamichael, who has worked with Payne before in his previous film, Sideways. Papamichael was also the DP of other films that I have seen as well, The Ides of March and 3:10 To Yuma. Both films has a gritty or dark feel to it's photography, so seeing his work here in The Descendants was shocking. His photography here is beautiful and bright. This intention definitely works with the direction that Payne was going for. There are multiple moments where Hawaii looks amazing. Papamichael definitely show the beauty that Hawaii offers and is definitely ironic when the voice over at the start of the film comes in. He definitely shows that Hawaii is paradise, regardless of what Matt King says. The intimate moments, conversations between characters, are mainly composed of close shots with focus on their emotions and reactions which is critical in showing the connection of each character to the topic that is being discussed, whether it's about Elizabeth or the property in Hawaii.The Descendants is soundtrack driven rather than score driven. This would have been a great opportunity to create a beautiful score to drive the film but the song choices for this film does it's job well. The songs doesn't feel like a soundtrack that stands out but rather it feels appropriate for the setting and adds on to the lightness that Payne is trying to create. The soundtrack isn't the greatest aspect of the film but it does add to what makes this film great.In my first viewing, I used to think it was a Clooney driven performance but in my second viewing, I started to see that it is both a Shailene Woodley and George Clooney driven film. They play off with each other well and it's definitely entertaining to watch. Clooney was already someone I expected a lot from but it was Woodley who definitely surprised and made me a fan of her acting. I'm glad to see a daughter in a film that shows a lot of her personality. Woodley shows the bad side of her, the edgy side of her, and the emotional and vulnerable side of her. The other supporting cast were great, in particular Judy Greer, Beau Bridges and Robert Forster.The Descendants is a film that kept me attracted to it after my first experience with the film due to it's striking photography and fantastic acting between Clooney and Woodley. It may grow on me further during subsequent viewings and the film has the potential to become a much more appreciated film in the future.", "publish_date": "2011", "category": "Comedy,Drama"}, "index_114": {"review_id": "rw6430194", "reviewer": "howard.schumann", "movie": "on the rocks", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "Each person has the opportunity to look deeper", "review_date": "1 January 2021", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Film critic Roger Ebert once said, \"All good art is about something deeper than it admits.\" On the surface, Sofia Coppola's (\"The Beguiled\") On the Rocks is a light comedy about a playboy father and anxiety-ridden daughter snooping on a husband suspected of cheating. The title could refer to Scotch (or Bourbon) on the rocks, a ship foundering off a seacoast, or the downward trajectory of a relationship. In this case, it may be all three. With Bill Murray (\"Rock the Kasbah\") as the sleuthing dad, Rashida Jones (\"Tag\") as the suspecting wife, and Marlon Wayans (\"The Heat\") as the would-be philanderer, on first glance, the film seems to be headed towards sitcom territory, another Woody Allen-Lite tale of over-indulged and well-connected New Yorkers (with a person of color thrown in to avoid stereotyping).A witty and affecting script by Coppola and busloads of chemistry between the two main protagonists, however, reveals depths that transcend such superficial judgments. Describing the film, Coppola says, \"It's the clash between the two generations . . . how they look at relationships, and also how your relationship with your parents affects your relationships in your life.\" Speaking of her famous father, Francis Ford, Coppola says, \"It's not my dad's personality. It's not my dad. But of course, you draw on things from life to try to make it feel real and connected.\" Laura (Jones) has, in her own mind anyway, some reason to believe that her husband Dean (Wayans) is looking elsewhere to fulfill his physical and emotional needs.A writer who has been unable to put anything meaningful on paper while she juggles her two young children's day in school, preschool, and ballet classes, Laura feels lonely and estranged from her oft-traveling husband. Her suspicions are enhanced by Dean's attention to his \"working\" relationship with co-worker Fiona (Jessica Henwick, \"Love and Monsters\") and bells go off when she finds a bottle of expensive body lotion in his suitcase. Laura is so preoccupied that she has tuned out others looking for support, particularly her friend Vanessa (Jenny Slate, \"The Sunlit Night\"), a single mom who is seeking advice about finding a boy friend in the New York scene. As they line up every day to drop off and pick up their children from Kindergarten, her attempts to engage Laura in conversation are met only with blank stares.It seems a bit out of character when Laura calls upon her wealthy art-dealer dad Felix (Murray) to give her advice as to how to handle the Dean situation. This especially raises eyebrows since the very same father is an obsessive womanizer who left her and her mother for another woman when she was a child. Knowing Murray as we do, however, we fall prey to his sly wit and the film rises and falls on the basis of his considerable strengths. Coppola says, \"He has so much heart and he's so funny and in a way that is so unique to him,\" yet it is Rashida Jones who, insecure and vulnerable, provides the human touch, mirroring the truth of their relationship and her engagement in a confrontation with Felix, though low-key is nonetheless powerful.Felix assumes, since he wants a relationship with almost every woman he meets, that every man is the same and Dean must be guilty, without concrete evidence of course, only suspicions. Felix becomes an updated version of \"Columbo\" as he stakes out Dean's comings and goings in New York, aided by cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd (\"La Traviata\"). He eats caviar along the way as a quick lunch, hides in alleyways, takes in the scenic delights of the city in his convertible sports car that has seen better days and, in spite of Laura's reluctance, the two end up in Manzanillo, Mexico in a scene that could have fit into any screwball comedy of the 1930s or 40s. Inclusion of pop songs of the era such as \"I Fall in Love Too Easily,\" \"I Get Along Without You Very Well,\" and \"Mexicali Rose\" adds to the connection. Equally hilarious is Felix's confrontation with two police officers who pull him over for speeding, but who end up succumbing to his master class in charm and giving his car a push.Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola's last collaboration, \"Lost in Translation,\" was about a connection in a foreign country that hinted at romance, but while Bill Murray's trademark dry humor was present and his character was jaded enough, neither character experienced anything deeper about themselves or the world around them. In On the Rocks, however, each person has the opportunity and the inner strength to look deeper and develop a new sense of understanding and trust. Here, Laura re-evaluates her priorities in life and her relationship with her father, taking responsibility for what works and what does not. As she looks inward, she heeds the words of poet Charles Bukowski to \"Drink from the well of your self and begin again\" or, as Chilean author Pablo Neruda put it, \"To have lived through one solitude to arrive at another, to feel oneself many things and recover wholeness.\"", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Comedy,Drama,Romance"}, "index_115": {"review_id": "rw6344771", "reviewer": "duncanzp", "movie": "here are the young men", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "A world far from glamorous", "review_date": "7 December 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Here are the Young Men, based on Rob Doyle's novel, was adapted and directed by Eoin Macken and was shown as part of the Galway Film Fleadh on Saturday, 11th July. The film follows Matthew, Kearney and Rez, three trouble-making young guys that have just escaped the mundane clutches of secondary school and are readying themselves for a summer of hedonism and the impending uncertainty of post-school life. Already seemingly jaded by the 2003 Celtic Tiger Dublin that they see around them, their outlook flips when a young girl is knocked over by a car right before their eyes. This tragic event underpins their summer; their responses leading to drastic measures and destruction.The trio's world is far from glamorous yet there's an energetic vibe; they are always seeking out the next thrill. On the one hand there is drugs and parties and a minimal amount of sobriety, yet they are still playing video games in their small stuffy bedrooms in their family homes. There is a glimpse of maturity and a brighter future through Matthew's relationship with Jen (Anya Taylor- Joy) but the dominant relationship in this film consists of Matthew trying to navigate his connection with the sadistically charged Kearney whose actions have become increasingly hostile and dangerous following the accident they witnessed.There is a high level of repressed emotions going on with these characters. The film encapsulates these under-the-surface feelings by showing the young men on television screens in an imaginary game-show situation. It's an enjoyable deep dive in nostalgia for early noughties technology- there's a glimpse of what appears to be a Nokia 3310 - however, TV is used here to tap into the emotions that the characters are really feeling. While the young men are stilted in expressing their response to the accident, they freely express themselves while performing on TV. In these high energy fantasy game shows the boys discuss how they really feel, want to be seen and how they understand themselves and their lives; existing in opposition to their difficulties to express emotion in real life with one another.Violence pervades this film as a central theme. The world as they see it is against them; uninvolved parents, disregarded by their teachers at school and the future an unsettling question mark. Following on from the accident of the young girl getting knocked down, the film explores the different ways violence can manifest. Each of the three characters respond differently to what they have witnessed. Rez's internalization and self-destructive manners increase whereas Kearney, already hot-headed explodes into a sadistic thrill seeker, whose actions can no longer be trusted, all in the pursuit to feel something. Matthew has to grapple with both of these contrasting violent responses, resulting in his own world and sense of self eventually crumbling.Centre any work on three under 20s and the idea of coming of age will always arise. Here are the Young Men is a dark and drug fuelled coming of age that pushes the characters to their furthest edges; coming out of the weed fog to become aware of the harshness of the world and of having moral responsibilities. The film explores the psyche of young men; unable to discuss how they feel their desires and confusion are externalised through sadistic and self-destructive acts. Overall, the film boasts some excellent performances and is an engaging reflection on toxic masculinity and the futility of the youthful highs that quickly lose their lustre - drink, drugs, and video games.DIR/WRI: Eoin MackenCAST: Dean-Charles Chapman, Finn Cole, Anya Taylor- Joy, Ferdia Walsh-PeeloHere are the Young Men screened on 11th July 2020 as part of the Galway Film Fleadh 2020 (7-12 July).EOIN C.

I have played many of Blizzard entertainments(he creator-company behind the Warcraft Universe) games and I have also sunk hours upon hours into the lore of Warcraft. And as both a gamer and a Warcraft lore nerd I think this is so far one of the FEW(If not the only) movies, based on a video-game franchise, that can hold up to the franchise it's representing. And with that being such a rare thing this movie deserves the biggest praise.With that said though, as a movie, it has obvious flaws. But also moments that are excellent. There is some parts that you just can see where Blizzard have had their hand in making things that are as true to what makes their video games on a unparalleled scale. And that is the \"CGI\". The Orcs and their home-world looks amazing and you cannot help but to feel strongly for the animated characters in many different ways just because of how they look, move, act and talk. It's truly, yet again, a masterpiece of art created by Blizzard. They really feel like they have a soul unlike many other animated movies and cut-scenes created now a days.With that said though. If I had not read and invested so much time beforehand and already knew these characters and where they came from I most likely would be VERY confused as to what was going on on the screen. Especially the first parts that throw you from scene to scene and character to character making it very hard to follow and get emotionally invested as to what's being shown. And even though that is not as big of an issue in the rest of the movie it's still there and it made made it hard to be able to connect to the characters as I wanted to and many of the witty and emotional scenes that could have been great fell short because of it.And when the \"CGI\" parts still won my heart due to how excellently made they are. The parts with real life actors made me cringe most of the time and also the choice of actors felt off. It made the movie at parts more feel like a mediocre sci-fi/fantasy TV show than a big movie production. I so wanted it work but I knew it was going to be hard for me even before I went into the movie-theater as I have never been a fan of the mix of animated characters and real actors. And when the non-animated parts feel closer to a low budget production than a high budget one it throws me off even more.Now I could have been fine with all of the non-animated parts flaws IF they had taken the time to develop all the characters and the story. I very much want to make a parallel to Lord of the Rings since if they had followed a similar model to LOTR and made the movie 30-60min longer and worked the scenes(specially the parts in the beginning) in a way as to not make it feel as rushed, not only would the choice of actors have felt as weak but many of the scenes in the movie would have hit closer to home than it does in its current shape. One could hope that there is a Directors cut or something similar to get your hands on in the future, if so, wait for that. It would be worth it.BUT with that said, for this to be one of the few(or the first) TRUE movie based on a video-game world that stays true to the world at hand it does get a big plus, as well as for the animated parts.As a video-game fan or a Warcraft fan this movie is a yes. As someone who does not have any prior knowledge or interaction of the Warcraft world, I don't see how this movie would be anything for you. But if you like amazing animations. Go for it. But you most likely will not leave this movie behind you with your emotions swayed in any way even though many scenes try to get you there.", "publish_date": "2016", "category": "Action,Adventure,Fantasy"}, "index_117": {"review_id": "rw3466379", "reviewer": "bkrauser-81-311064", "movie": "magnolia", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "Not Sure What to Think But I Know How I Feel", "review_date": "5 May 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Paul Thomas Anderson; when filmophiles say the name, it is uttered with such reverence that the man may very well be canonized the contemporary patron saint of film. Offering a comparatively limited array of millennium masterpieces, PTA as he is lovingly sometimes referred to, perfectly balances his films' complex intellectual tapestry with a strong emotional core. The man is an admitted film-freak, listing influences as varied as Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick and Max Ophuls. Pare enough layers and you can see how PTA apes certain images from these infamous auteurs. Yet his themes are wholly their own, mixing loneliness, isolation, family dysfunction and in the case of Magnolia, cosmic coincidence as a means to his cinematic end.Magnolia follows an ensemble of interrelated and fatally flawed protagonists over a three day period. All are somehow connected to the L.A. based Partridge Productions owned by the elderly Earl Partridge (Robards). Earl is dying of cancer and asks his nurse (Hoffman) to contact his long-ignored son Frank (Cruise) who now makes his living as a professional pick-up artist. Meanwhile Partridge Production staple, the quiz show What Do Kids Know? is airing live with host Jimmy Gator (Baker Hall) who is also dying of cancer. Gator struggles to repair his relationship with his daughter Claudia (Walters) who has developed a cocaine habit and lives in relative anonymity. Meanwhile one of the show's contestants, Stanley (Blackman) is waffling under the pressure of his domineering father. The film is also book-ended by narration provided by stage magician Ricky Jay who offers further tales of the Ripley's Believe it or Not variety.I am truly at a loss of what to think about Magnolia. It's a messy, dense and demanding movie that grabs your attention through the power of sheer pathos. The common thread of resentment towards fatherly bonds certainly begs the question and offers theories about what Magnolia is about. Yet any interpretation on PTA's singular vision falls short; torn asunder by complex editing, parabolic storytelling and characters histrionics. The film is big, the film is ambitious, the film (at over three hours) can feel punishing. And in the end resolutions are left frustratingly obscured amid the chaos. Many audience members will likely feel jipped though I remind you, life itself often makes no sense; why should we presume to find intellectual cogency in our art.As we bounce energetically from one story to another, the audience is never feels lost in time, rather the film condenses and expands time in playful and interesting ways. For example: the quiz show for all its cerebral quality, is used as a stapling plot-point for most of the film's threads. Presumably the show takes place over half an hour, yet within that time, more than an hour of the film is un-spooled.Magnolia is unequivocally a minor masterpiece of world building. The film reaches its emotional apex twice; within the first 20 minutes and within the last 20. Characters fiercely clash with one another like starved rats in a cage, helped in some cases by the presence of drugs, alcohol and in Tom Cruise's case alpha-male braggadocio. After a time, the characters settle into a routine awaiting the next existential crisis that gives them grief and the audience indigestion. Tension builds and builds as heroes and villains face off. And just when you think you can't take anymore, the film rewards with a plot-point so out of left field that you'd swear the Old Testament God was smiling on Magnolia's L.A. denizens.I don't know what to think about Magnolia, but I know what I feel and I'm certain the feelings evoked by this film are purposeful and prove PTA to be a masterful storyteller. The film makes its audience run the gambit of emotional resonance, elevating its broad-stroke temperament with near operatic persistence. The camera, with its near omnipotence forces us to ask questions about the story and more importantly about ourselves. How do we control or alter our reality? When should we forgive? What problems left dormant in the past effect our lives in the present?

As usual, I also didn't watch the trailer or any clip. Based purely on the cast and the synopsis, I actually expected a fun, lighthearted movie, where an important story about sexual orientation and homosexuality would definitely be developed. While I'm not entirely wrong on the last part, The Boys in the Band is far from being one of those Sunday afternoon's flicks people occasionally put on their TVs to entertain guests for a couple of hours.It possesses two distinct halves. The first contains one of the most captivating introductions to the characters and the overall narrative I've seen this year so far. From the very start, Mart Crowley and Ned Martel's screenplay is packed with interesting conversations, and every actor is able to elevate their script by being incredibly realistic and spontaneous. Each character has a clear personality, and their relationships are cleverly established. It's definitely one of the best films of the year regarding character development since every single one is explored beyond just one or two lines of characterization. Technically, the one-location set always pleases me, and it works beautifully in the context of the movie since it never deviates the focus from the characters and their personal stories.However, the second half couldn't take a more shocking turn. The once lighthearted tone drastically changes after Alan (Brian Hutchison) enters the party. An uneasy, uncomfortable atmosphere fills up the apartment, and it never leaves, not even after everything's over. It's an emotionally heavy, even tiresome story that takes every single character to their absolute limit. Secrets are revealed, omitted truths (those that everyone saves deep inside not to hurt their friends) come out, and alcohol plays a good part in all of this. Nevertheless, it's not really one of the film's central themes, even though there's a clear message regarding that subject as well.Homosexuality (how it was and still is treated by society) is undoubtedly the narrative's primary topic, but I believe \"sexual orientation\" to be the ultimate theme in The Boys in the Band. In fact, an even more general analysis concludes that the main message follows the \"accept who you are\" and \"don't be afraid or ashamed of what you enjoy\" guidelines. Consequently, it becomes a more accessible movie since it never feels like it's closing itself, excluding people outside of the target audience. Everyone can (and should) enjoy the film's thematic component since the debates that characters have with each other are extremely meaningful for today's society.The chaos that dominates the apartment feels surprisingly genuine and natural, creating a comparison with what occurs daily, everywhere in the whole wide world. The writers' treatment of homosexuality and sexual orientation is profound and really well-developed, exploring those phases that thousands of people go through: confidence, shame, uncertainty, acceptance, and so much more. Honestly, if someone feels uncomfortable while watching this movie, then someone must be wrong with that person. Yes, it deals with preconceived notions, sexual discrimination, and many other aspects related to this subject. However, in the end, it's not a film exclusively about homosexuality but about people accepting themselves for who they are without fear or shame.The cast and the characters they portray are what make The Boys in the Band such a great movie. I can't go into details about everyone, otherwise, this review will never end, but I do have to mention a few. Zachary Quinto (Harold) portrays Jim Parsons' (Michael) frenemy and his weird, philosophical, enigmatic interpretation as the birthday boy steals the spotlight on several occasions. Brian Hutchison is incredible as Alan, the \"ugly duck\" of the whole situation, whose sexual orientation is questioned throughout the entire film. Hutchison does a great job of never leaving the viewer clearly see through him. Everyone else is terrific, but I offer a final shoutout to the hilarious Robin de Jes\u00fas (Emory) and the always fantastic Matt Bomer (Donald).Jim Parsons delivers a performance that's on a whole other level, though. If he doesn't get awards buzz, I genuinely don't know what else an actor needs to do to achieve that. Just like the narrative's structure, Michael also has two distinct personalities, depending on the level of alcohol in his blood. When he's sober, Parsons shows that quirky side of him with his funny facial expressions. When he's drunk, he becomes verbally violent, aggressive to his friends, and a terrible host. He's the catalyst of the story, the engine of the whole movie. Without him, nothing happens. Parsons takes that responsibility and delivers a memorable performance, one of the very best 2020 has to offer.As mentioned before, Crowley and Martel's screenplay is exceptionally well-written, possessing tremendously entertaining dialogues. I don't think I've ever watched an adaptation of a play that actually convinced me to want to watch the latter. However, it's precisely due to The Boys in the Band being a play-to-cinema adaptation that I have the following issue. The moments where a live audience is supposed to clap or repeat a catchphrase are way too obvious, taking me out of the film on those occasions because I feel like something's missing or a character is forced to \"replace\" the nonexistent public.My other issue is related to Michael's game in the second half of the film. It pretty much occupies the last hour, and while it starts in an interesting, emotionally compelling manner, it gradually becomes monotonous and way too predictable. It becomes a tiresome cycle where everything that's supposed to happen, occurs without major surprises. Some unnecessary flashbacks also stretch the runtime, besides being the only moments where the viewer leaves the suspenseful, tense apartment, which I didn't really appreciate. In the end, two storylines are left open to interpretation, and I couldn't love these narrative decisions more. There's no right answer, only our own interpretations.All in all, The Boys in the Band is one of the best play-to-film adaptations I've seen in quite some time. It actually convinced me to see the original version if I could, which is a statement to how much it impacted me. Yes, it's a movie that focuses on homosexuality and sexual orientation. However, it never feels exclusive to LGTBQ+ viewers, much on the contrary. It transmits a general message of acceptance and self-worth, something everyone can connect with. Mart Crowley and Ned Martel deliver a screenplay that treats its themes in an astonishingly genuine, meaningful, natural way, creating a clear analogy with not only the 60s but also today's society. Every conversation is fascinating and engaging. Characters debate essential subject matters that everyone should listen to and learn from. Regarding character development, Joe Mantello's film explores its characters more than any other 2020's flick so far. Every actor incorporates his role perfectly, but Jim Parsons deserves a few awards for his emotionally powerful display. Occasionally, the adjustment of moments where a live audience would interact doesn't quite work. The second half's game becomes repetitive and predictable, extending the runtime for a tad too long (also due to unnecessary flashbacks). The two ambiguous storylines that end the movie are the cherry on top of a really good cake, which I definitely recommend to everyone to take a bite. You'll undoubtedly get something out of it.Rating: B+", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Drama"}, "index_119": {"review_id": "rw3421778", "reviewer": "Quinoa1984", "movie": "letter from an unknown woman", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "melodrama as grand opera", "review_date": "25 February 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Sometimes you watch a film dealing with the story of a romance and the filmmaker will be content enough to reside in the realm of melodrama, of heightened emotions serving a tale of doomed romance - or maybe it won't turn 'doomed' per-say, but the stakes are always so monumental, incredible and just downright heightened that some in the audience may need handkerchiefs for their un-dry eyes and noses. For Max Ophuls, going past melodrama was a key thing. The ingredients in Letter from an Unknown Woman certainly make up melodrama, and as I watched the film I thought it would just comfortably rest there. But it was in the last reel - and especially in the minutes after the end, where I could let my mind catch up with what I was feeling - that this is closer to grand opera, and it's by nature of how determined, how passionate and versatile Ophuls camera is. He is such an active participant, but by making us the audience as well, that it raises the stakes even higher. This is a fabulous but painfully sad movie.It concerns the (mostly) unrequited romance between Lisa (Fontaine) and Stefan (Jourdan), the latter being a concert pianist who comes to take a room with her family when she's younger. She sees him play, and see him with his swagger and confidence, and is smitten right away. Does she know really that much about him? Who cares? The piano seems to express how soulful, how achingly beautiful he is - but more than that how he is not quite happy with how far he's gotten (when he stumbles playing at one point, it seems like maybe he breaks something in disgust with himself - and later she comments on this to him, that he hasn't found what he's looking for). But she leaves with her family and she never gets to tell him who she is or how she feels. Until...But no, the letter that Stefan is reading from is not at this point, which he comes across in his room as he is plotting to run away from a duel with a man who is after him for such and such a reason (and suffice to say you'll figure it out after a while, perhaps). They do meet some time later, when she returns to Vienna and they share one of those perfect romantic evenings that people may have in real life as well as in the movies. Unlike earlier in the story when she's shy and reserved, here she does open up a little more (though in this first real date she won't say she was there during the time they shared living quarters), and he is about the most charming guy on the planet in that moment. It's the kind of date where, I suppose this was a thing in the early 20th century, they go for a buggy ride... with the backdrop being changed by operators.It's interesting to note that at first I didn't really notice that the backdrop was fake until the buggy first stopped. And for a split moment I wondered, 'hey, come on, can it be that cheap a production to... oh, wait, no, it's supposed to be fake.' Thinking about it more, this is kind of like a good metaphor for their relationship - it has the veneer of gorgeous scope and splendor, but when you look closer it's not real. Jourdan has to go away after their very brief whirlwind romance, and she is left with a baby. She gets married, and the story goes ahead to years later, when the child is older and Lisa is now married to a well-off man.Again, you can see many parts of this story I've just described have the air of melodrama: a woman pining for a man she may (or may not) be able to have, and that her passions take on another light when seen through the framing - the framing is the essential thing, what sets it up as being all about the 'hindsight-is-always-20/20' aspect - that you don't know what you got until it's gone. And of course Fontaine and Jourdan are so terrific in their roles, with the former beaming with young love in the early scenes (I almost didn't recognize her in the slightly 'lower-class' get-up), and on through the middle section with her and Stefan's date, and Jourdan is... well, kind of a matin\u00e9e idol, almost too good looking, if that makes sense, like deceptively the perfect guy.A lot of the brilliance of the film comes down to its economy of storytelling - it's a brisk 83 minutes, though it doesn't feel too short while watching it - and that Ophuls is not one to ever keep things static. Even that buggy scene where they share a magical moment of connection in conversation and perhaps more, because of that backdrop we're not feeling as if this is something stagey or stolid. And yet I don't feel like the technique is there just to please Ophuls demands for a crane shot here or there or most places; the high style is there for the high emotions, that this is a woman expressing how she felt through much of her adult life, and the fact that this guy seemed to be caring for her but on a totally superficial level, and never for very long.Letter from an Unknown Woman is a tragedy of taking things for granted, of believing love at a certain level will be reciprocated, and the fluidity of style matches the fluidity of intense emotions that, when broken, become all the more gut-wrenching.", "publish_date": "1948", "category": "Drama,Romance"}, "index_120": {"review_id": "rw3473927", "reviewer": "vivianzhu", "movie": "x-men: apocalypse", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "Enjoyably Mediocre", "review_date": "21 May 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "I'm quite torn about this movie, as it is quite a 'different' movie. It has an intriguing enough story line, with mostly convincing characters and impressive visuals...I certainly enjoyed it while watching it, but after the fact I could not find a reason why I enjoyed it so much. It is certainly a film with many flaws. As an 'action movie', the action scenes were not too innovative or even impressive. The fights are largely what has been seen before in the X-Men franchise, just less of it compared to Days of Future Past. As a 'superhero ensemble piece', the fact that it was an 'ensemble' definitely took away from individual story arcs. With nobody really developing from the start of the film to the end of the film, at least not clearly. As a movie, the plot was incredibly clich\u00e9 without many stakes. Superhero movies don't necessarily need heroes to die in order to have stakes, it just needs emotional weight and connection between characters, and these connections being morphed or broken (like Captain America: Civil War). Apocalypse however, had no such stakes, only the threat of world destruction...which obviously would not be accomplished. Though character arcs were lacking in this film, performances by the leads were mainly good. With the clear exception of Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, who continues to feel like she has no connection with the character whatsoever. Both McAvoy and Fassbender gave great performances as usual, with great chemistry between them as usual. Especially with that one scene of Fassbender in the woods, the emotional layers in his performance were incredible. All the new X-Men also gave good performances, though the ensemble element drowned them and cut their development short. All up, Apocalypse wasn't the worse X-Men movie, but it is far from the best.

The story is pretty simple a group of gay guys gather at a duplex to celebrate the birthday of a pal, and along the way this safe space leads to coming out honestly about love while being who they are and the movie is a reflection of how they deal with society.

All these things come together to create something special and can manipulate your feelings to what's important at the moment it's atmospheric, calm, and slow at times, and then it can be horrific, frightening, and fast paced, or it could have a melancholic mood it's very versatile. A Caveman and Dinosaur are able to form a deep emotional bond with each other after a tragic turn of events. Their character dynamic is one of the best things about this show and how they come to trust and help each other is amazing. Again as I said before the direction, and visuals, are phenomenal and the use of sounds truly immerses you into the world. I had to say that again because of the importance of those elements because there's barely any dialogue at all (and don't let that turn you away either I never felt bored watching this the action is great and engaging) these things are it's best aspects along with its symbolism, themes, and storytelling. Each episode is unique and different all having importance in either developing the characters emotional connection, or focusing more on its themes of birth/demise, life, cruelty, love/loss, compassion, importance of connection, respect, religion, empathy/sympathy etc. Power is a necessity for survival in this world and killing (most of the time) is inventible this is realistic considering the time period this story is set in.

The real Captain Philipps acted a lot less heroic and more ignorant than in this movie adaption that simply tries to do what many recent Hollywood movies do. They portray the hard but honest everyday life of a seemingly normal American citizen who suddenly faces big challenges and becomes a national hero. In times of governmental shutdown, economical problems and a slowly progressing decline as the world's most important nation, the people needs a few new heroes to believe in American society again. In this movie, you see how democratic institutions, dominant military forces and social cohesion defeat corruption, exploitation and selfishness in the worst among the developing countries. The film presents the United States of America and Somalia as complementary antitheses which feels a little bit like lazy propaganda. While the main villain constantly expresses a positive opinion about the American dream and how he could have a better life in that country, I must though admit that the movie also shows us the dark sides of some typically American values as individualism and weapons happen to be completely useless to resolve this movie's issues. Diplomatic elements, earthiness and shrewdness are the key elements leading to a predictable happy ending instead of a loner's brute force. Apart of its minimal propaganda tendencies and the predictable ending, I didn't like the character of Captain Philipps at all. I'm not sure if Tom Hanks wanted to portray an arrogant and unsympathetic old bourgeois but if this was the intention of the makers, his acting is simply perfect. If the intentions were to create a sympathetic main actor, he completely failed though. It's hard to tell but usually, this kind of movie tries to create an emotional connection between the main character and the viewers and this movie just doesn't manage to build this up. From the beginning on, I had no connection with the main character and didn't really care about his fate.Another small but important element I didn't appreciate was the fact that the main villain's English was so good. It's more than just a surprise that a pirate living in a desperate country ridden by a bloody civil war for more than two decades is able to speak English so well. I'm not sure if a young man like this ever had the chance to go to school at all. That's why this little detail and the general profound interactions between Captain Philipps and Muse feel a little bit too fabulous to me.The movie's strengths are elsewhere. First of all, this film is filled with incredible tension and especially the claustrophobic and uneasy last third feels very intense and real. The acting is only one part of the gripping formula. The great soundtrack, the efficient light effects and the out-thought camera positioning create this nervous feeling. The movie starts as a documentary in the first moments, slowly turns into an atmospheric thriller towards the middle, then it gets a refreshing action boost between the second and last third and it ends as an oppressive chamber piece. This mixture is very well balanced by the makers and the movie never gets boring in my opinion. Even though the content of the script is sometimes flawed, its general segment linearization is of the highest quality.The film also has its dramatic and philosophic elements as the villains aren't just brutal criminals but four very young and sometimes naive men who have no choice but to go through this hell to stay alive and take care of their elders and own families. The acting of the four Somalian pirates is simply outstanding and especially the performance by Abdi Barkhad is absolutely authentic and intense. Sometimes, the movie doesn't feel acted at all as if the real persons were replaying the tragic events that really happened in a slightly transformed way. This is where the movie almost looks like a documentary of the most intense kind.Despite its little flaws, this movie is truly intense and feels authentic. The first third has a few lengths but the last two thirds will keep you on the edge of your seat as almost no other movie this year. While the story itself and Tom Hank's acting aren't very good, the claustrophobic atmosphere and the incredible performances by the four young African actors are worth a few Academy Awards.

With ten separate storylines, this film covers a wide variety of relationships and explores different types of love. I think that if this film had focused on one particular storyline it would not have been as effective in portraying an overall feeling. By delving into the relationships and lives of people who all seem to be connected somehow, the film allows the audience to feel like they are part of a larger community. It also should be noted that this film has an excellent soundtrack with several recurring motifs that add to the connectivity between the multiple storylines. The film also frequently uses music as a way to transition from one storyline to another, which brings the stories closer together and makes the film more cohesive and fluid.\nWhile on a surface level I do love this movie for all the heartfelt love declarations and sense of holiday cheer, I do see the many flaws of this film as well, which is why I cannot give it ten stars. The biggest problem I have with this film is the obvious lack of diversity. There are ten storylines in this film with each one exploring a different kind of relationship, but even so, all the romantic pairings are heterosexual, and only one of the couples is multi-racial. While this film is successful in representing different types of love and love at different stages of life, it falls behind when it comes to representing the love between members of the LGBTQ community and in representing the love between POC. I understand that this film was made in 2003, and the media has become much more representative, but it is still important to look at older films with a modern lens so that we can work to keep improving the ways in which we tell stories like this. Another issue I have with this film is that there are several uncomfortable and inappropriate relationships that involve power dynamics in this film, and while Hugh Grant's character addresses the problem of being romantically involved with his employee, that is not the case for others. Both Colin Firth and Alan Rickman's characters become involved with employees of theirs and this is never addressed as being inappropriate in the film. While Colin Firth's character is no longer his love interest's boss at the time they get together, it still is uncomfortable how many of the relationships in this film stemmed from the male being the female's boss. Again, I don't think that a film produced in 2020 would include these kinds of relationships where a man has clear power over the woman, but it is important to recognize the problematic elements of any film, regardless of when they were produced.\nOverall, I do think that despite the problems, this is a solid Christmas movie from a surface-level perspective. The cast is full of extremely talented actors and despite the content itself being fairly cheesy, the actors make the script feel very real and believable. I am always particularly impressed with Emma Thompson's acting in this film as she gives an extremely emotional and raw performance without seeming over-dramatic. With such a talented cast I don't think this film would be as good as it is, the performances by a lot of these actors are what really sell the love stories. The beauty of this film is that it does give off the feeling of real, genuine, love at Christmas-time. More specifically real, genuine, hetero-sexual love between attractive white people. But if you're looking for a little Christmas fluff that shouldn't be taken too seriously, this may be the film for you.", "publish_date": "2003", "category": "Comedy,Drama,Romance"}, "index_126": {"review_id": "rw3477830", "reviewer": "undeadfearz", "movie": "x: first class", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "The best X-Men film", "review_date": "28 May 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "You're probably thinking that my opinion of this film being the best X-Men film is totally wrong - but hold on. Many people simply dismissed this movie, because there is no Wolverine (not completely) or Ian Mckellen or Patrick Stewart, and it is another origin story we didn't need. they could not have been more wrong. First Class is a stylish, fun and downright emotional film. The actors have been perfectly cast, with the highlight being Michael Fassbender as Magneto/Erik Lensher. As usual, Fassbender makes you connect with him on an emotional level, and we get to see his story arch evolve as he goes from scared child, to revenge seeking bad ass, to a slightly wiser mutant, who resembles the Magneto of the original trilogy. Alongside him is James McCavoy as Professor Xavier, another great piece of casting here, who brings a witty charm and charisma we'd never expect to see from Charles, as well as the serious tone and eloquence that have received from Patrick Stewart. Both younger alterations of Magneto and Xavier are different from the originals, but we see them start on the path towards their older selves. Whilst there was sometime spent on building their friendship, I only wish there had been more, and the impact the end of the movie has on Charles (in Days of Future Past) feels slightly overwhelming, as the relationship between the two could've been stretched out further. The rest of the cast are great, with Jennifer Lawrence as a young mystique/raven, not yet set on her path of wrong doing, as well as Nicolas Hoult as Beast/Hank. The script is bolstered by the backdrop of 1963, and the Cuban missile crisis, which adds a sense of realism to the movie - which can be difficult when there are people with devil tails and others who can catch the explosion of a grenade. The movie also does the comic due respect, finally introducing the classic yellow uniforms, steering away from the Blade style black leather, and the movie has a uniquely retro feel to it. The majority of the emotional scenes revolve around Magneto, as the movie attempts to humanise the yet-to-be villain. The standout involves a scene where Xavier helps Magneto boost his powers - it is truly emotional and makes your hairs stand on edge, further bolstered by the acting talents of McCavoy and Fassbender. Other good points are that the special effects are good, the action if creative and always fun to watch, and the music is a respectable score for such a good film. Whilst there are many references to the previous X-Men films, I don't feel that you need to have watched any of the others to appreciate First Class, although it might help when it comes to a certain hilarious cameo.

After Star Wars and more recently Avatar, there has been a tendency to build computer generated worlds but only fill them with aliens and laser guns. Science fiction films where technology and special effects are used to explore human behaviour and make sociopolitical comments about the present and the future are becoming increasingly scarce. Fortunately, director Spike Jonze (creator of oddball favourites Being John Malkovich and Adaptation) has made a science-fiction film that is partly a glimpse into the future of advanced computer software, a current day look at our over-reliance on technology and also the unlikeliest of love stories. Who would have predicted that one of the more aching screen romances in recent years would be between a man and his computer? What is more frightening about the premise is that you come to believe and be touched by it. The film is set in the distant future of Los Angeles, with Joaquin Phoenix cast as Theodore, a shy writer whose profession is to produce love letters for other people. He is detached from the world because of a painful breakup from Catherine (Rooney Mara). He still has some joy from seeing his college friend Amy (Amy Adams, pivotal in a subplot), who has her own dysfunctional relationship. His life takes a bizarre turn when he is introduced to Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), a highly sophisticated, verbalised operating system, put together from the DNA of her creators. She is described as a consciousness, able to think and feel on her own, gaining new experiences by herself and through what Theodore sees. She is carried with him in a portable device, like a smart phone, and together they fall in love. Jonze completes the extraordinary tasks of avoiding the most obvious movie clich\u00e9s and pitfalls that could come with this utterly bizarre concept. The film succeeds as a human drama because the director finds the right tone. It's sometimes hilarious (how could it not be?) but the mood is mostly melancholic and dream-like because no one here is playing this as an extended joke. This is a sad world where characters, including Samantha, are craving human connection and longing for new experiences and emotions. The dramatic conflict is real because as Samantha begins thinking and feeling for herself, and grows closer to Theodore, he begins making the same judgments and pedantic criticisms of her that affected his previous relationship.Hollywood's exploration of man's relationship with computers, from HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey to The Terminator, has mostly revolved around their destruction of us. Jonze aims higher, attempting to answer challenging philosophical question relating to epistemology and existence. When machines are capable of thinking, feeling and learning does that knowledge stop them being robotic and draw them closer to true humanity? Contrastingly, as humans grow further away from each other and become more reliant on technology, will we forget personal uniqueness and that people's desires are different from our own? On top of its plethora of ideas, we take the film seriously because the actors do too. Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film is subtle and challenging. The long duration of unbroken close-up shots on his face provides time for him to embody the shifting emotions of joy and anxiety that a relationship can place on a person. The close-ups also infer that humanity and individuality is defined not merely by knowledge but our own unique faces that define us within our species. Scarlett Johansson, who replaced all of Samantha Morton's original voice work, makes a strong case for Oscar nominated voice acting. With her singing background, she knows how to alter the pitch of her voice, infusing it with both humour and emotion. Her disembodied presence becomes charming and sad, rating as some of the best work the actress has ever done. The film's visual compositions are also an expression of social detachment. Los Angeles is this film reminded me of China with its high rise buildings covered in a grey, overhead smog, which hints at the power corporations have in the future. To express Theodore's isolation, his apartment looks partly cold but also modern, with its metal and glass surfaces. It is old and new, reflective of his psychological inability to move forward from his personal mistakes, despite all the technological advances around him. Similarly, in the film's production notes it states that his clothes were designed with a 1920, 30s and 40s look. The retro costume stylising, combined with a wide angle lens as Theodore walks outdoors talking to Samantha, further suggests his segregation from genuine human emotions in the present day. It is worth noting that in 2003 Scarlett Johansson starred in Sofia Coppola's film Lost in Translation, where a character was rumoured to be based on Spike Jonze because he used to be married to the director. Like that film, this is a story about a character that is fractured and hurt by one relationship and faces the impossible task of fulfilling that void with something that is inevitably unsustainable. The sincerity with how this beautiful, slightly long film is made, and the quality of the performances, are suggestive of a filmmaker who knows very personally what they are talking about.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_128": {"review_id": "rw5374636", "reviewer": "Ascendingsun", "movie": "rambo iii", "rating": null, "review_summary": "The rise of a crucified and resurrected God on screen.", "review_date": "2 January 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "If you haven't seen any Rambo film, this installment might be the most fundamental part of the character and the series. Rambo was since the beginning portrayed more as an abstract walking symbol or an ideal, in modern age some people also used to call him a comic book-like character, as the time went on it has gradually found its truer essence throughout the series, peaking in this 3rd film, essentially existing as an apex of the series with two films on both sides rising up to it. And that is what compels me to point out what actually makes it stand out high and above all the others.First of all, in my view the true potency of cinema is to portray not a person (a social construct), but a multi-dimensional symbol that can mean various things for various people, and that is the venue that we call a true art, as subjective as it is, it offers open space for the viewer's imagination or interpretations to use art they perceive as an allegory for things in their life, The same like poetic word play of Bible or spiritual literature (Wuxia, Journey To The West, etc).Rambo III serves as a good example of this artistic approach that filmmakers took here, similarly like the early Steve Reeves films, One Million Years B.C with Raquel Welch, or the western Cemetery Without Crosses, presenting an open imaginative canvas for the viewers to add in their intutive input, here the character Rambo is very multi-dimensional, for he is intentionally made so much as a blank slate that is leaving lots of space for various ideas that people have about him, and the same goes for a few other characters in the film as well. The film as a whole has a striking ethereal quality to it, and that is its strongest point.The film feels very raw, as if it came right from the Middle Ages, glorifying the spiritual journeys of a warrior and his war, as a soldier on the battlefield I know I would be very inspired by this depiction rather than the modern tales that condemn and criticize violence, you wish to survive right there on the field and not cry about it, it glorifies darker aspect of life for honourable reasons, some people with no experience on battlefield may not be emotionally connected to it. It doesn't propagate war, it is conferring more of a symbolism that uses a hightened scenario to speak highly and loudly rather than a reality with its graphic detail pounding us over the head what the war conflict is like. It comes from a more holistic perception and objective like any sculptor or painter that uses simple shapes and colors to portray complex reality. I think these are the most substantial reasons why films like Rambo 1, 2, 3 tend to be more popular and accessible to the larger audience that prefers a more positive energy that uplifts the spirit, cause the more you go myopic and specific into detail and show or explain (ie. Rambo 4, 5), the more separated you are from the whole, less holistic and balanced = the negative energy segregates, positive unifies, the basic energy states that all films are made out of.The film is not concerned with grounded view of reality to engage the mind as much as the ideals to inspire the heart. The 80's Rambo is essentially touching the field of mythical Greek Gods and the holy wars, it is indeed very allegorical, it was easier to make an animated tv show, or play like Rambo as a child, or creating a fighting and political symbol, as a comparison in the 4th film the artistic abstraction and theatricality of cinema goes slightly more out the window and the viewer is left with less symbolism and individual co-authorship as a perceptive contributor. The same like a documentary, it shows you, it doesn't make you imagine and see what you wish to see. It's like a difference between an opera and a cinema verite. On the one hand it doesn't create the greater potency of cinema, it dumbs down or takes away from the viewer the space to observe art in ways that offer more questions than answers, on the other hand, it allows the creator of the film to be as specific and clear as possible, so everyone understands, while avoiding the unwanted controversy or reception. Not just in the visual sense, but it is also true in terms of the character development in the 4th film, characters are more clear, reality-bound and expressive, we even hear Rambo's own inner voice spelling his thoughts out, even though as a film it still retains some degree of wonderful abstraction.Whereas when looked back at this previous film from 1988, it is almost in the mystical realm itself, that's how far it goes, many words can point to many meanings, action and story remain more elusive or left to the imagination while standing on the platform as simple as possible. This is all a reflection of the time, the digital era is evident where films are more graphic with more detail, not just in terms of picture clarity, but also in story-telling itself, things are more spelled out. The last two films do it more than the 3 films from the 80's. It's not dumbing down the violence, it's doing it to the viewer on many levels, it insults the intelligence when it aims for real-world extra accuracy to be relatable, the viewer is supposed to use imagination to work for it by believing what is presented to them without demanding it to reach their knowledge of the real world and its limitation, which for me is not really a noble purpose of art.\"The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge, but imagination\" - Albert EinsteinTo me this film comes to me as the deepest of the series with regards to the development of Rambo, and that might as well be why some people find it boring, the whole film is revolving around the transformation and adaptation of a character coming together as a whole man, finding people who are like him while adopting their own belief system to live and die for a higher cause. His faith that keeps him going high and low I find inspiring in its unsaid subtlety. The melancholic music score, cinematography, framing, the relaxed pace, desolate location, characters, all of those are reflecting this development, the style that is probably seen as boring for some people who focus more on the surface, the only place where they can be met with depth or meaning.In this film Rambo can seem like a God, a resurrected man in a higher state of mind, that seems intentional mirrored by the belief that Rambo adopted - dying as a man to become one with the universe serving the higher ideal, the Sufi belief that many Afghan tribes used to live by, this supernatural aura running through visually and narratively is a huge part of its relatable appeal to me and my own way of being. The similar kind of style I find in a film called Alexander, also with a similar public reception and development of the character becoming God-like. For a long time I believe the way these two films were received in the west is deeply linked to this intangible style of the films betraying the certainty of the cynical mind attached to tangible reality, the same mind usually seeking proof for existence of God, it betrays the archetypal codes to get excited or emotionally relate. The emotional core drives the action in all Rambo films, when you relate, the action supports it, when you don't, it's just action. Although the burden of perceiving depth beyond the surface of life is always upon the people, not outside of them.The color yellow permeates this film, it is a color of home, solar plexus, the center of our power, the commanding inspired strength and adaptability. That is an important distinction in terms of development, as we can feel Rambo finding himself out of his element in a wide open desert discovering his way forward and who he is for the first time. No need for story twists, emotional dramas and loads of dialogues, that's all for entertaining the 5 senses of the masses, the film is already aplenty of visual language for inner eye and ear that can demand repeated viewings to catch more information running underneath. I remember in the mid 80's Stallone seemed quite interested in doing a film with as few words as possible, to say more with little, this film might have accomplished that intention. It feels very Asian or Middle Eastern as a film that's quite removed from the Hollywood sensibilities, that may as well be due to the involvement of the gifted producers with backgrounds in and around those regions.Immensely powerful film, existing for one section of society superficially yet subliminally, and for the other deeply in all open senses of awakened inner body, to this day it has not lost its power and magic to positively influence one's life as it did for me in the late 80's. It has synchronistically mirrored the revolution of 89 in Europe and the fall of the Soviet Union of the early 90's. It is one of those film experiences that seem to transcend cinema altogether, as it can be a formative experience while growing up. The first time I've seen the film it had such a profound affect on me that I was left completely speechless, my life was never the same since then, it's the kind of affect that modern mainstream fare like Dark Knight or Joker could have never matched, such films come and go, limited in their relatable appeal worldwide, Rambo was buried in the psyche for a long time after this, it speaks louder with simplicity of story and images that easily transcend cultures and time.It's all about standing in the right resonance, to be in perfect alignment with a films like this. Each film in existence has its own highly resonating receiving end. The right kind of an audience at the right time and place with the highest appreciation, such an audience is a perfect energetic counterpart to what they experience.

His only solace was leading others to it, that they might enter and lead a better life than him.\"This was an idea from the Bible that had always stuck with me from Sunday School classes from my childhood. Paris, Texas is a modernised version of that passage, and it struck such a chord in me emotionally that I had to re-watch it the day after. I now consider it one of the, if not the, greatest film of all time.Travis (a mercurial Harry Dean Stanton) wanders out of the desert not knowing who he is. His brother (the always reliable Dean Stockwell) finds him, and helps to pull his memory back of the life he led before he walked out on his family and disappeared four years earlier. Travis decides to reunite his family, leading him and his young son, Hunter, on a journey in search of his wife, Jane.Even though Robby M\u00fcller's cinematography is perfection throughout. (Seriously, the colours pop in such a way that the film regularly looks like a work of art) The true beauty of the film is Wim Wenders' and Sam Shepard's ability to create characters that feel so real. I never thought I'd be able to emphasise with every single character of a film, but it's testament to both Wenders and Shepard's genius as filmmakers that it's possible in this film. The phrase \"cinematic poetry\" always struck me as an empty compliment, but it makes total sense to use it to describe this film. The one way mirrors of Jane's occupation speak so much volumes and furthers the divide between the man and his wife. It is not until Travis explains his behaviour that the barrier between them is broken. They are fully able to understand each other, and realise that the possibility of reuniting is truly unavailable. The physical barrier still exists, but the emotions they feel are able to conquer any border. Like all art for me, I can appreciate it even more if I feel an emotional connection to it. No other film has struck me emotionally in such a strong way in years. Travis leading Hunter to Jane in the hope of starting afresh as a family, and then leaving because he knew he couldn't be with them is just such a heartbreaking and beautiful idea to me. He wanted the best for the ones he loved more than his own life, and the best was not to be with him. So the man has to go on, leaving all that he holds dear and start again on his own accord with only the knowledge that they're happy together to keep him comfort. Truly stunning.

This film is absolutely not for everyone. I can see the mainstream crowd or anyone looking for a chick flick \"rom-com\" absolutely hating this. However, from a film buff perspective I really enjoyed this. It has its faults but it is one of the most unique films I have seen in a very long time. Within the first half hour I knew the film had to be nearly completely improvised and it turns out that it is. They knew what the scene required but there was no dialogue or script pre-written. It makes nearly every scene awkward and tense and feels bizarre and you know what? It brings out some real talent and makes the scenes also feel very real. The entire concept of this movie and each scene feels very much like real life. It is entirely about relationships, friendships and the connection between men and women. It is heartfelt, sad, funny, awkward and just unlike anything else out there in this genre. There are few films that have evoked emotions from me like this one did. I think I actually felt some of the same emotions the characters did because it felt real.Some of this cast I already thoroughly enjoyed and one particular actress I have always struggled to like but she finally, truly impressed me in this. That actress is also the producer of this film and that is Olivia Wilde. I loved her on House and since then she always seems to take roles that don't suit her. Well, she was brilliant in this. She is a driving force on the cast and her range of emotions is impressive and handling the improvisation is flawless for her. I adore Anna Kenrick. More and more lately and she is terrific in this. She is soft spoken, adorable, worldly and she also shows some really powerful emotions. I actually think Wilde was a little better in this (that's really something for me to say that) but Kendrick was terrific. Both girls have really interesting chemistry with Jake Johnson who I believe now more than ever is a terrific actor. I like him on New Girl, loved him in Safety Not Guaranteed and now this!! He is the stereotypical macho guy's guy in this. A blue collar worker with a girlfriend who is really his opposite and a best friend who is a girl as well. He has distinct chemistry with both of them that is very different. The three of them make up the bulk of the film and each of them trying to wade through the eccentricities of love and platonic relationships or the idea of one. Ron Livingston has a small role early in the movie as Wilde's boyfriend. He is good but doesn't get a lot of depth to his role and is mostly there to serve a specific purpose to the story of the three others. Jason Sudeikis also has a small cameo as Wilde's boss.This to me is a near perfect \"art-house\" film. It makes perfect sense, its not convoluted or tries to show off its uniqueness and yet it is the type of movie you could talk and talk and talk about. Its the sort of thing a psychology class could dissect to pieces. It is the furthest thing from mainstream and that is actually why I liked it so much. Joe Swanberg wrote and directed the film and I have not seen his other work but this was truly impressive for such a young director. I hope this helps him get noticed certainly. I will say that I didn't completely care for the ending and yet it sort of made sense to end it the way it did. This isn't a Hollywood movie and there is no grand love gesture and nothing is really tied up into a neat little bow. The title certainly makes sense because these people...drink...a lot. They do work in brewery but alcohol flows like I have never seen. This is a captivating look at relationships in a completely unique way and if you're not afraid to venture into something a little different, I encourage you and implore you to try this obscure little indie drama/comedy. I certainly won't forget it. 8.5/10", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Comedy,Drama,Romance"}, "index_131": {"review_id": "rw2911018", "reviewer": "TheLittleSongbird", "movie": "les mis\u00e9rables", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "Not only the best version of the book, but also one of the best films of the 30s", "review_date": "24 November 2013", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Don't let the long length deter you, the story is such a big one that is very rich in detail and does need over 2 hours at least to tell it. This film is not just very faithful to it, the most faithful out of all the adaptations, but tells it absolutely thrillingly and with great emotion too. You are drawn into Hugo's world and in the time of the Revolution and along with the 1978 adaptation this is the version with the best characterisation(Valjean has never been this well-realised on film). While Javert is not as prominent as other adaptations his scenes do have tension and there is the feeling of he and Valjean being polar opposites as well as mirror images of one another, the sewer chase is thrilling, Valjean and Cosette's father-daughter relationship has never been more charming, the Revolution scenes have a real emotional intensity and immediacy that has been unparalleled on film and the romance is not shallow nor does it feature too much. In fact all the character relationships are explored beautifully and don't out-balance one another, one will argue that the rest of the characters pale next to Valjean here, I don't agree I think they are all convincing and it's mainly because Harry Baur's performance is so good that there may be that feeling. But it's not just how well it scores adaptation-wise that makes Les Miserables(1934) the best version of the book and one of the best of its decade but how it works so well as a film. There are more lavish and authentic adaptations of the book(1935, 1998) but that says very little because the costumes and sets are still beautifully rendered here and the Expressionistic style the photography and lighting adopt are equally striking. Arthur Honnegar's music score adds much to the atmosphere too, it is sweeping and grand yet emotional and subtly haunting too. The film is brilliantly written and treats the story and Hugo's prose like it knows that it's a classic(and Les Miserables is). The story doesn't run out of steam, allows time for things to develop and never feels too rushed or too structurally thin. And as said early on in the review what is so powerful in the book is translated every bit as powerfully here, and you can tell that everybody connected with their roles and what they're going through, kind of like it's affecting them in a personal way. Of the performances, the best by far is Harry Baur, that he is the only actor as Valjean to properly fit the role physically(Gerard Depardieu in the 2000 mini-series comes close but not close enough) is one part of the allure but every better is that he gives a towering and in this viewer's mind definitive performance in the role, noble, emotive, tragic, charismatic, initially immoral and later redemptive. Charles Vanel is a very icy and ruthless Javert, one person you wouldn't want to cross paths with and there is a tense dynamic between the two and that Javert is very strongly principled. The only thing that has been done slightly better in other adaptations is Javert having a more vulnerable side. All the performances are fine, Fantine is deeply affecting and Cosette and Marius are the least bland their characters have often been since, the only reservation is Eponine being too old(and we're not talking a bit here) but she still is written and portrayed very convincingly so it isn't too much of a hindrance. And of course Raymond Bernard's direction is superb. Overall, a magnificent film, both as an adaptation- the best film adaptation of Les Miserables by a mile- and as a film in general. 10/10 Bethany Cox", "publish_date": "1934", "category": "Drama"}, "index_132": {"review_id": "rw5781522", "reviewer": "winkust", "movie": "ordinary people", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "A Masterpiece", "review_date": "29 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Ordinary people is about 3 people(Beth, Calvin and Conrad their son) who are dealing with the aftermath of the death of the other son.Conrad is anxious, depressed and full of guilt about his brothers accidental death, Beth the Mother is emotionally distant from Calvin the father but especially from Conrad, Calvin the father is like the glue that is trying to hold the family together that finds himself in the middle of the turmoil between Conrad and Beth.Another character worth mentioning is Conrads shrink played by Judd Hirsch who helps Conrad to work out why he feels the way he does and above all is a rock for Conrad as a friendThe characterisation in this film is exceptional, each of the characters even the more unlikeable ones are shown as complex multi facted people and allowed to show their humanity , their struggles, their good sides and their dark sides, Beth the mother for example although she is emotionally distant and you could almost say she is cruel you can feel her pain, you can feel that she wants to connect emotionally but cant.

The newer generation taught us to be more open and thoughtful with our sexual desires, expressing them freely, and not restricting them as if sex was an unnatural thing. Connecting this to film, as I so often do, just look at how Americans have quietly been told to fear sex. A violent wartime epic can still achieve a PG-13 rating, while a three second shot of a vagina will stamp you film with the \"kiss of death\" NC-17 rating. How have our private parts been so private we've resorted to embracing the unnatural and the cruel and fearing the natural and the serene? Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice was made in 1969, right on the teetering edge of the hippie movement and during the \"free love\" movement, where marriage was seen as a restraint on ones well-being and pocketbook and the state had no business in dealing with it. The film, judging by its premise, deals with the concept of swinging or \"wife-swapping,\" when it in turn, deals with the ethics and moral values that get in the way of doing such acts. We explore the lives of two couples, ostensibly similar on the surface, but royally different when examined. The couples are Bob and Carol Sanders (Robert Culp and Natalie Wood), a trendier, more liberal couple, while Ted and Alice Henderson (Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon) are your more straight-shooting, square couple, highly indicative of the parents of sexually promiscuous teens in the 1960's and 1970's trying to understand their teenage sons and daughters.Bob and Carol spend a weekend at a couples retreat, one of those camps that allows for emotional honesty between married people to flow and allow for deeper feelings and emotions to penetrate one another. Because of the impact this has had on them, Bob reveals to Carol that while working on a film set he slept with another woman in an act he called \"purely physical\" and not emotional. Carol accepts this about as well as a wife could, believing Bob, admiring his honesty, and carrying on her own way, even casually revealing it to their best friends Ted and Alice, who are appalled at the thought. Alice finds herself especially sick with the idea that Bob could do such a thing and then reveal it to Carol who isn't the least bit upset with him. Damn western hippies, I tell you.This prompts Ted and Alice to have a lengthy nighttime conversation about the affair, the impact it could have on their friends in the long term, and if they themselves are sexually promiscuous at all. This is one of the many great talks in the film, focusing sharply on human emotion and feelings, two things often traded in American cinema for punchlines and vulgarity. In this conversation, Mazursky leaves the camera turned on the couple for a long period of time, listening to the conversation, hearing what both has to say, and leaving us with a lot to contemplate by the end of talk, whether we're single or married.These kinds of dialogs that go on for a while and leave the view in a self-contemplative state are fiercely common in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, including the nudging idea of \"is it possible for a couple to be married for a lifetime and not have sexual feelings for another women, be them expressed or regressed?\" Throughout his career, Mazursky has been interested in character, marriages, the arguments and debates that a husband and wife have, but most importantly, relationships. When I say \"relationships,\" I don't mean those confined to a marital or dating relationship but various relationships people can find themselves in.The actors here couldn't have been more perfect for their roles. We have the unbelievably gorgeous and beautifully mannered Natalie Wood in a role that requires impeccable conviction and plausibility, given the tender nature, Robert Culp in an equally uncomfortable but rewarding role, with Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon assuming the role of the uppity parents trying to comprehend this \"sexual openness\" these couples speak of. All of these actors, equipped with Mazursky's and co-writer Larry Tucker's biting dialog, help illustrate the generation gap where sex is a revered act that should be kept on the down-low or sex is an act embraced and discussed.With Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice, Mazursky and Tucker ask the biggest questions I've seen them ask yet. Is free love something to embrace or condemn? Is swinging, wife-swapping, or an orgy lethal to a marriage and its long-term prosperity in health? Is it healthy in itself to casually dismiss an affair or harp on it and risk losing the one you love? To show that these questions are still very much alive and the idea of sexual openness is still one discussed today, the modern-day film equivalent to Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice is Joe Swanberg's Drinking Buddies, a film that clearly is influenced by Mazursky's film right down to its poster. Both films explore the aforementioned ideas, only one takes a much younger cast and puts them to use while the other takes couples grappling with an older age and simply trying to fit in.

The film takes place in some point in the future - or, since we are never told exactly when, it could just as well be an alternative reality where people just need that one extra step being already hooked up to their devices - and is about a man who writes love letters and cards to others for a living. He's good at it because, well, it comes from inside him. But coming off a divorce that's left him \"confused\" as he says, an 'O.S.' Operating System, an artificially intelligent super computer that with a few simple questions is meant to be 'made' for that person, it's tempting enough to try. Going into the film, I thought it would be a sort of 'rom-com' only with a Hal 9000 (and can you say 'wackiness ensues' more than that). It's more complicated by how much Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson, so she sounds like the perfect gal already) is, a side from being a super organizer (she reads and organizes emails and correspondence), an emotional creature. But in a way this dug deeper than something Kubrick just scratched the surface at: if you can really 'be' there for someone, though not in full physical form, what does that do to the real human being on the other end? Joaquin Phoenix, aside from Jonzes delicate and mature screenplay and poetic direction, is the reason to see the picture. He imbues this 'Him' as a kind of sad dope but one that's a genuinely caring and nice fella but not always connected with his own emotions or knowing quite what to say. He is awkward with those glasses and mustache, he plays his oddball video games (an adorable aside in the film, a few times really), but projects a haunted, morose quality without it becoming tired or trite. At the same time he shows the happiness Jonze wants to portray in a relationship, whether it's with his current 'gf'. Or his once wife (Rooney Mara, and we get to know her so well mostly only through dialogue-less flash backbacks, with some editing input by Steven Soderbergh). He also plays well on some of the moments of comedy that do pop up in the film - it is Jonze, so as it is such a personal film the light and absurd comes in with the gloom - a part of this world But, like us, wondering 'what the hell is this now? Her does science fiction and technological 'if' material so well because of its subtlety. when you watch something like, I don't know, Elysium or even Minority Report, we know it's a future place and the fantasy is big and flashy and sometimes we know we are removed from that experience. Jonze wants this to just be like how it is today, and the sci-to 'catch' is there, for the most part, as a means to explore how we see and feel and experience one another. I left this film questioning so much how I can approach potentially expanding AI in the future (And now we have systems winning or at least even friggin playing on Jeopardy so it's only a matter of time emotional components are worked out). What does one do with the infinite possibilities with a self aware being. and as in Being John Malkovich, there's always another layer of chaos and wonder that is under the surface waiting to be explored, and in the third act the entire concept of an AI of this magnitude is given a frightening element: being in thousands of places at once but still 'here' at the same time, including love. But it doesn't ever quite 'feel' frightening, and that is a key thing that makes Her special.Another director might take the narrative into more conventional territory, like if Samantha and her other O.S. beings (which, after a while, they are) took over the world real Skynet style. It's still Tim Twombleys story, his journey into finding some semblance of peace with himself and the world, and if it feels at all like a personal film for Jonze it's because he sticks with that painful, powerful point of it all being about you, your other, and growth (along with the help of pleutonic friend Amy Adams, another fascinating character who we understand almost immediately). Her is must-see stuff, something with pure sentiment (not sentimentality, that edge is so fine to walk on), and an approach visually that also takes this premise and does it seriously, so when a guy is running around and laughing with his little 'pod' of a person, it isn't implausible and a joke, it's simply something 'there' in the world.

What else is there that we should care about?I will not take away points from a mindless summer action movie just because it's all action and no depth but I just felt like I couldn't care for anything or anyone who was having bad things happen to them. There was no emotional involvement or enough of a back story for me to get involved emotionally.The actors seemed to be overacting at part and, at times, seemed to be very wooden. I'd feel worse for your character if you just showed me that you actually cared about what's going on. Charlie Day was fantastic as the comic relief. He plays a scientist who is an expert on the Kaiju. I believe Charlie Day is great in every movie he's in and his future is a bright one. You also have a very funny cameo from Ron Perlman, who you may know from Hellboy, who plays a black market Kaiju parts dealer. Rinko Kikuchi, the female lead, was also pretty bad ass. Although, through her intense emotional back story, you found it hard to care about what she went through. The characters don't react to it very well, which is disappointing because her story is the reason why she's involved in the project. Same goes for the lead, Charlie hunnam, who plays Raleigh Becket, who's emotional back story is the beginning to our story. After the beginning, you tend to forget what happens, as you are taken away through the epic battle scenes that take place.I must say, the action scenes were breathtaking and the CGI was just spectacular. I had chills every time a battle scene between the robots and the monsters was happening. Although, at times, it seemed very hard to follow as everything was happening so fast. I did see it in IMAX 3D, which made the experience enjoyable in terms of sounds and feeling, but didn't help the movie as the darker scenes were the scenes that were harder to follow, and more of the fighting scenes happened in the dark and in water. Rain and splashes from water seemed to have gotten in the way of the blows between enemies which made it hard for me to be completely blown away.Pacific Rim was your typical summer popcorn action flick. Lacking intelligence but making it up with visual eye candy and loud noises. Sometimes, that isn't always a bad thing. We expect this sometimes in summer movies. It's what we look forward to. For all of you thinking this is a Transformers rip-off, no need to worry. This is a smarter, darker take on mindless action. Not a lot of explosions or hot girls. Just something to have a little bit of fun with.Grade: B-", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi"}, "index_136": {"review_id": "rw6088120", "reviewer": "IamROCKAS", "movie": "heat", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "A bit over-ambitious but I love what this movie accomplished", "review_date": "12 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "At this point, I'm pretty sure that Al Pacino is a slightly toned-down version of Samuel L. Jackson, yet he still has the right tools to make every character he portrays badass.To be honest, I'm not too sure how to feel about this movie. Yes, it was definitely intense, as I expected something bad to happen at any moment, it was phenomenally well-acted, even excluding the big names of Al Pacino and Robert Deniro, the cast is really talented and gave their best here, and it was almost perfect on a technical level, as it was shot, constructed, and put together in beautifully. Yet, I'm feeling conflicted and I can't say that this movie is amazing or even really good. I'm not going as far as saying that this movie is bad, so I want to explore a bit deeper here and find out what kept me from liking this movie as much as most viewers did. This is a brand new concept that I'm trying out, so expect a lot of mind vomit, I just hope this turns out well without being a novel-length read at the same time.To begin, this was a crime epic, a procedural drama, and a film noir of incredible scale and ambition. Besides the classic \"cops and robbers\" scenario, this film has more layers to it - the most distinct one is the machismo of two men from completely different backgrounds. One is a professional thief, leading a criminal syndicate, and the other one is a hot-headed detective that is pursuing them. This relationship between the two lead roles quickly becomes a melodrama as the movie begins to explore their personal lives, all their troubles concerning their field of work and relationships, and the dilemmas that hang over their professional lives. On one hand, this unique view explores the duality between the men as we get to explore these characters in depth before the conclusion of the movie, but on the other hand, this extends the runtime to three hours. This way, the action sequences are more memorable as they're easier to distinguish from the sea of other character development scenes but at the same time, they kind of feel insignificant as they take make a rather percentage of the movie.Looking at the beginning of the movie, you already start to get a slight taste of action and what's coming later. In a gripping heist sequence, we get introduced to the term \"score\" and the first one is a treat. It ran as smoothly as it could have until Waigro lost his temper and killed one of the guards, forcing the killing of the other two as they were witnesses. This gave us a glimpse of what kind of sadist Waingro actually is even before he went into a prostitute killing spree. But the key point to the plot was what happened after that score, as Neil met Eady. Later in the movie, we learned about his professional code, which stated \"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.\" but it was around here that his code was tested and he started to look into this relationship as something he might never need to walk out. I also think that's why the next heist seemed so desperate to him, as he planned it to be his last one.On the other side of the action, we have Lieutenant Vincent Hanna and the LAPD division, that is hunting Neil and his crew down. Hanna, already on his third marriage, is working relentlessly, while neglecting his wife and step-daughter, who is showing some signs of depression already. To be honest, I didn't really notice it at this point and only connected the dots during one scene at the ladder end of the movie. Hanna at this point is pretty much ruining his home life by giving every inch of his attention to his work. This is where we start to see the difference to our two lead roles, as Hanna, as just mentioned, looks to his work while Neil starts looking to his relationships.When two sides are put face to face, they don't look all that different. We have arrived at one of my favorite scenes at the movie - the coffee scene, as I like to call it. As Hanna's home life was crumbling to pieces and he was unable to catch Neil, who was just too slippery and clever to fall for his ruses, Hanna pulls out an interesting move (a pro-gamer move, if you like) and engages Neil face-to-face and invites him for a cup of coffee. As the two men engage in conversation, we notice that they relate to one another: Hanna is seen pitiful about how his devotion to his work has put his home life at the brink of collapsing; Neil expresses how his relationship with Eady might not last as his code states that he might have to ditch her at any moment he feels the heat (hey, that's the title of the movie!). We can see that these men have mutual respect for each other, even though their occupations are bound to put them against each other sooner or later. Besides being a great scene, I think this is the height of both of these actors right here. Pacino here is ferocious like Samuel L. Jackson with the audacity of Liam Neeson and De Niro here is level headed like Anthony Hopkins in \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and intimidating Kevin Spacey in \"Se7en\". In other words, this is like fire vs ice as both actors bring out their best, one portraying a hot-head relentless workaholic and the other is a patient, strategic and devious.The coffee scene is followed by a bank robbery. Usually, we have these kinds of action sequences at the end of the movie but here we have it around the middle. After this scene it got evident that the movie definitely isn't about the crimes, the heist, or the scores, it is about the people that get involved in them. As the heist is almost as a success, a violent standoff erupts, people on both sides lose some of their men. What follows is a bit of chaos, as to sum most of it quickly, Hanna finds his wife's lover in his home and takes away the TV because he can't stand him watching his TV, Eady learns about Neil's occupation as a professional thief and she's hesitant but still agrees to go start a new life in New Zealand with him, Hanna's step-daughter attempts to commit suicide (which sort of came out of nowhere as we haven't seen her much prior this scene), Neil tries to cut loose ends by killing Van Zant, who tipped off the police about the heist... okay, let's stop here. As Neil and Eady were finally home free, Neil suddenly learns about the whereabouts of Waingro and his instincts send him on a detour to eliminate him once and for all. The stealthy infiltration of the Hotel by Neil was a work of art, I'll admit that. After that, we have a pivotal scene as heading back to Eady, Neil notices Hanna and, being a man of his code, turns away from her while we are left to witness the fragile confusion of the heartbroken and abandoned Eady's face. The rest went by quickly as Hanna followed Neil into an airport and shot him in an anti-climactic scene. Their chat for a bit before Neil dies and that's how the movie ends.The duality of a cop and robber over here concerns drama and action. Our two lead roles aren't complete opposites, that are usually present in this genre - they are but mere men with shallow lives that are slowly collapsing because of their addiction to their field of work. Because they live in the same grey zone, they can relate to each other. Both of their stories are tragic but Neil takes the edge here. At the end of it, Hanna got his man while Neil's own discipline made anything outside his own rules impossible and eventually fatal. His love for Eady made him feel invincible and he created his own fate by going against his own principles when he decided to go after Waingro. His own rules have done this to him. Hanna's admiration for Neil leads to killing him without hesitation, perhaps knowing that he would rather prefer to die and not go back to prison. This admiration of his opponent to that degree makes the last shot of the movie overwhelming.I labeled this movie as a crime epic, a procedural drama, and a film noir before but that's barely the extent of the film's epic stature. It is much more than Al Pacino and Robert De Niro portraying a cop and a crook but defining a movie as complex as this is a challenge for me, yet complexity isn't shy of great cinema entries. Attention to the score, the soundtrack, camera lenses, locations, wardrobe, lighting, and the use of both realism and style with the thrill of robberies and the emotional significance of the story make this experience worthwhile.Almost finishing up now and only one question remains - why did I fail to really enjoy this? I gave a lot of praise so far but that's mostly out of respect for what this movie accomplished. My mind vomit manifested into a plot synopsis more than anything else and all I've got to say is that this movie feels real. Too real. The pacing is slow, rarely boring. During the bit that ended up being a plot synopsis, I skipped some bigger scenes or just downplayed them because there wasn't much to talk about. The sub-plots took too long here and some of the key scenes seemed to end really quickly just as you got excited about them. To sum it up, I think Heat was a bit over-ambitious with all the emotional scenes, and that ends up with some scenes feeling insignificant or even unnecessary but combining that with the action sequences that we did get and Al Pacino and Robert De Niro trying to out-macho each other makes this an enjoyable movie.", "publish_date": "1995", "category": "Crime,Drama,Thriller"}, "index_137": {"review_id": "rw2483110", "reviewer": "Michael_Elliott", "movie": "the karate kid", "rating": null, "review_summary": "One of the Best of Its Type", "review_date": "2 September 2011", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Karate Kid, The (1984) **** (out of 4) Terrific drama about a teen (Ralph Macchio) who moves cross country with his mother but soon finds himself under attack from a group of teens. After he's brutally beaten, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) makes an agreement to enter him in a tournament if the kids allow him time to train. If you read many reviews of THE KARATE KID, even the positive ones, you're probably going to see the word manipulative several times. There's no denying that this film is predictable and there's no denying the fact that every scene tries to manipulate the viewer into a certain emotion but who cares? THE KARATE KID is without question one of the best films of the decade and it's also one of the best of its type from any era. There are so many reasons why this film should have fallen flat on its face but a lot of credit has to go to director John G. Avildsen because he makes sure that things never get corny and he is so terrific at building up the characters and the drama that you can't help but get caught up in everything you're fed. I think most people will be able to connect with the Daniel character and Macchio does a terrific job at bringing him to life. Morita gets the role of his career and simply kills it and ends up becoming one of the most memorable good guys in the history of cinema. The two actors have such a warn chemistry that one can't help but feel their relationship grow and even more important is that it comes off real. The film has one of the greatest underdogs, one of the greatest good guys so we have to have a great villain and we get that in William Zabka and Martin Kove who play the main bully and his master. The two are such creeps that you can't help but hate them and want to see Daniel win against them. Elisabeth Shue also turns in a very strong performance as the love interest. It's really remarkable to see how terrific the cast is as all the leads and everyone down to the extras fit their roles perfectly. I'm sure many will see connections to ROCKY, which was also directed by Avildsen but I think this movie is even better. The drama is so real and the emotions that the characters go through are so dark and true to life that you really can't help but feel for them and what they're going through. The film is quite dark in spots but it's also got a terrific heart and message that really make it so memorable. There have been many imitators since (and a remake) but there's no question that THE KARATE KID is something special and something that really can't be touched.", "publish_date": "1984", "category": "Action,Drama,Family"}, "index_138": {"review_id": "rw2936017", "reviewer": "grendelkhan", "movie": "man of steel", "rating": "4", "review_summary": "Superman for the Video Game Age", "review_date": "5 January 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Let me preface this by saying I am a fan of Superman. I grew up reading the comics and they helped shape my moral outlook. Superman grew from wish fulfillment in the Great Depression into an icon of the best of humanity; at least, as much as a fictional character can embody that. He went from being a character created to entertain children into a figure of modern mythology, known the world over. I still remember standing in line to see the Richard Donner film and watching the story unfold; cheering as Christopher Reeve flew towards the camera and then banked off to the side. Superman has been adapted to the times; and so, given that it sometimes feels like we are in very dark times (war, shootings in schools, government shutdowns organized as powerplays, environmental disasters, etc...) we get a dark Superman. However, it can't even find the human connection in the darkness. Instead, it wallows in video game-like destruction, with few consequences for the principal characters. The Screen Junkies group, in their brilliant Honest Trailer, summed it up best: \"God forbid a Superman movie be any fun!\"The film first serves up a Krypton that is derived from Avatar, with little to make us care about its destruction. It might have as well been the prologue to a game that is immediately skipped so player can start punching things. Next, we get a Cliffs Notes summation of Clark's isolation from humanity, while he tries to find his purpose. Smallville (the TV show)it ain't. Again, we just seem to be marking time before we start smashing things. We next encounter Lois Lane, who apparently has ticked off the military but goodness knows why, given that she doesn't exactly exude that charisma that a star investigative reporter would have. Then, enter Zod and company to start the destruction.I could live with mindless destruction if I gave a damn about the characters. Henry Caville is a lump of beefcake with the emotional range of a turnip. Amy Adams, a decent actress, doesn't exactly fill Lois with the personality of the hard-charging reporter. There is no spark between the two, unlike Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. Their relationship is really rather clinical, like the script is afraid to have real emotions, for fear of losing a teenaged male audience. So, instead, we just start blasting and smashing things, with no visible consequences to innocent bystanders or regards to the laws of physics. Even Avengers managed to bring moments of the human cost of things to the moments of destruction.There are germs of ideas here, like the potential reaction of humanity to a known alien, especially one endowed with tremendous power. The idea that the government would feel threatened by a power it can't control. The film never really gets beyond introducing these ideas as it instead goes for effects work to keep up the visual distractions. As such, there is such an artifice to the film that the viewer has trouble connecting to anything. The only human moment that meant anything to me was at the end, when we flashback to young Clark running around with his dog and Jonathan Kent recognizes the potential in his son to be a hero for humanity.The end result hear is a dark and soulless film. I keep returning to the metaphor of a video game because that is how I felt during the film. What little story there is exists only to bridge the next effects scene, with little future consequence or character development. It's not storytelling; it's marking time. Richard Donner is still king and Christopher Reeve is still the truly iconic Superman. Warner would be better served talking to the creative people at Warner Animation, who crafted the brilliant Batman The Animated Series, Superman TAS, and Justice League. They were able to create epic stories with believable characters. Smallville was better able to craft a relatable hero out of Superman and put a new spin on the myth, while still paying homage to the legacy.Do yourself a favor, watch the Donner film, or Superman the Animated Series. Seek out Elliot S! Maggin's novel \"Superman, Last Son of Krytpon.\" Read one of the thousands of classic stories from the past 75 years; or, play a real video game because at least then you will be able to have an active involvement with the story.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi"}, "index_139": {"review_id": "rw5784270", "reviewer": "rgkarim", "movie": "the high note", "rating": "6", "review_summary": "Need To Practice More To Produce A True High Note", "review_date": "30 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "Another pandemic weekend, another chance to release a movie on to streaming services to try and keep some normalcy alive. This weekend, a movie that snuck up on me until about the beginning of May arrives to your rental pleasure. It's a film with potential drama, comedy, and music, as a potential gaze through the window of stardom tries to make itself relevant in the modern day.

I'd say from my studies and talking with friends who have professionally sang, this movie has it's fingers on the pulse of the difficulties of the music world. The High Note shows all the red tape, connections, and fickle shifts that can happen in building and maintaining one's career. In essence, this is the underlying tale to connect much of the early part of the movie and was the factor keeping me engaged into the film despite all the drama at hand. To help break up the monotony there are some romantic parts, but the comedy was the more engaging part to liven up the movie with Ice Cube's part being the main chuckle fest in his delivery and timing, though his scenes did get a little old after some time. Instead the actor who really saved much of this movie for me was Harrison Jr's role, the young man bringing a combination of acting and singing that will be those flash in the pan moments that will renew your attention and potentially inspire you to care about one of the characters. Harrison's scenes often held the most dynamic moments in all of the film, again expanding on rather shallow characters and adding the pizazz to the music industry movie. He especially comes to life about half way and near the end of the film, which helps me transition into the next like of how the ending manages to tie stuff together with a little bit of surprise to help add some band, which given the start of this movie is definitely needed. The ending finally starts making sense of the direction the film is going, and hits with those final emotional punches and gimmicks that left me satisfied and somewhat impressed given most of the movie I watched. However, the biggest clap for me is the portrayal of music and the brilliant pokes this film does at the trends created over the decades. The High Note is an homage, and almost a study, of the power of music, helping poetically dissect impact of songs, show the motivational power of the tracks, and even how tastes very for the sake of safety and commercialism. Covers and plays of the original tracks await the ears of the viewers, but for me the original work holds a lot more heart and emotion to potentially lead to soundtrack sales in the near future.Now those were the likes that I had to stretch out, but this movie definitely has a lot of shortcomings that I personally did not enjoy. For starts much of the movie is disjoined, nearly the first 45 minutes a finger-painting mess of plots and genres that turn grey instead of a fabulous spectrum of colors. Curiosity kept me going, but one again directors and writers seemed to try to cater to too many gimmicks to make a cohesive opening. From viewing the trailers I expected this film to be a drama of pressures of assistant/music life that developed into a buddy movie, but that was only a sliver of the complicated weavings this group chose. The change in atmosphere was not to my liking mostly because the atmosphere was not smooth, the chaos again just not working given my expectations I walked in with. Of course, the shallow behaviors of greed, cheap laughs, and elaborate fashions await this film too, and while it works so well for painting the celebrity/high roller life, it at times also becomes too much the focus of the film. Lost in this setting, dialogue suffers, character development becomes lazier, and the forced insertion of a track gets a bit stale, especially when the diva/bad behavior gets in the way of the messages and power the film I think was aiming for. While the political aspects are fortunately kept on a short leash, when they rear their head it's bit in your face, not so much annoying, but again derailing the fluidity of the scene before me for what would be foreshadowing for an already predictable plot. I think most of these errors could have had more slack by me, but they are magnified by the very slow pace this movie takes. Yes, I know I like faster paced genres, but this film's dragging out, bloated run time with no direction was an uphill battle I waded through, only finding it's pace nearly 50% of the way into the film where that monotony started going away. Yet even the second half cannot correct the throw away characters this film holds, which outside maybe four of them, plague this film's writing. Rival stars, self-centered best friends, loyal roommates, and even agents are secondary messes that play their part and nothing more, with many reduced to simple one-liners. Little character development and integration makes this cast feel sort of mashed together, potential plot elements and feeling heavy anchors dropped to sink into the shallow dismay of a mention and nothing more. Hopefully this review highlights that the film did have a lot of nifty ideas and potential paths for developing a struggling woman in a very chaotic field, but to repeat once more that lack of direction tears much of it to shreds with only the last 30 minutes present to tie it altogether and end with the things I sought out in this movie.\nTHE VERDICT:The modern age of movie writing seems to have a lot of agendas, changes, and catering pushed in favor of cohesive plots. High Note hints at the potential it could have brought with the realistic dives into the entertainment world, the talent of some of its actors, and the awesome music that brings the biggest punches in this drama/music special. Sadly, it is the lack of direction mixed with too many aspects that really destroys this film for much of the 2-hour run time. With throw away character, shoddy plot development, and bad pacing with an already unfocused story, you will not get the full bang for the twenty-dollar rental in this reviewers eyes. As such, this is a big wait for watching at home via streaming, and one should instead find the soundtrack and enjoy the numbers this group brought to play.

I saw the film on August 26th. After the long break, I was very happy that finally a blockbuster was shown in the cinema again - and then Nolan! I was looking forward to intelligent, exciting entertainment with an innovative story.\nI watched it at 3:00pm, there were about 16 people in the cinema. Although there were always 4 empty seats in between (?), the cinema was clearly empty. I felt a bit sorry for it, because with that few people you probably can't even really afford the maintenance costs. Maybe it was just too early in the day.\nNow to the film.\nShortly to the boundary conditions, after Internet the film has an unbelievable budget of about 225 million dollars, so almost a quarter of a billion - and that's where the problem starts for me. With such a budget, there must be no logical errors. I have no problem if the story takes place in a fictional world, in which certain laws of nature are overridden, or if, for example, beings with \"superpowers\" exist, as long as they are comprehensible, with a certain motivation and behave within the limits of this world. If the chosen world is relatively \"normal\" in its physics, like here in tenet, then it is also the case, for example, that if a figure jumps from the third floor, it does not do so without violation of the rules, but breaks a foot. This is for me part of the inner logic of the world resp. of the event and is for me the part, which makes the event (within its laws) logical experienceable and realistic. Likewise the actions of the persons should fit to it, be it that they are driven to actions by external compulsions, self-preservation or due to predictable consequences.\nThe actions and the physical robustness of the characters do not fit into this framework for me at tenet. Here are two examples. In the opening scene, our protagonist has the task of bringing an object from an opera performance in Kiev and its bearer with his team to safety. The performance is attacked by terrorists who shoot wildly around the area. Shortly afterwards, the building is stormed by a special unit. He and his team join this special unit undercover (which felt that 2 minutes after the attack they were already on site and of course stormed the opera house immediately), reach their target and could bring it to safety. At the same time he notices that explosives are being laid out throughout the building. What does he do? He runs around to find the explosives, gets into a fight with the special unit and the terrorists and, thanks to the fact that the explosives have a digital display, he can throw them (10-12 pieces) into the upper, unoccupied ranks at the last second (about 2s before ignition), leave the building at the same time and watch the explosion while running out - and you can hardly believe that all this succeeds. For me this is not necessarily realistic, but rather cheap showmanship, also because of the countdown on the explosives. This copy has been seen in various films from my point of view much more gripping - even if perhaps not with the optical stimuli - the concert hall was already impressive.\nAnother example is the theft of Plutonium 241 from an armored convoy: police car in the front, armored car in the middle, police car in the back. His plan is to wedge the convoy between different trucks in the middle of the city highway, jump on the armored car and steal the Pt241. Now Pt241 is not a harmless thing in the described world, and the policemen or special agents who protected the convoy are certainly no beginners. But here, truck on the right, no reaction of the escorts, truck in front, no reaction of the escorts etc. . Probably their thoughts were: \"Oh, they are driving up close, and another one... they don't want to attack us. Nooo, but not here with us, we are in Tallin...\". That's just way too easy, and that doesn't really create any tension. Of course the action succeeds here as well. The accompanying policemen weren't even stupid \"First Order\" soldiers, but simply not present in the whole scene, no fight, no complication, nothing. Thrill potential somewhere around minus 1.\nFor me, the portrayal of the \"super agent\" in the film called the protagonist was also quite difficult. After the action with the opera he gets into the hands of some enemies and is interrogated. Why this happens at a freight yard makes sense to somebody, if only because of the beautiful pictures. Anyway, he sits on a chair, his teeth are pulled out and at the last moment he catches a deadly capsule, swallows it to escape interrogation and then, bang, blinds and he wakes up in a sick bay on a ship. How? No information about this. And the best: \"by the way, we have also re-inserted your teeth...\". Okay, makes sense. Not that implants can take half a year, but maybe it was only the cash and the third parties.\nIt's just these cross-fades, hero in greatest need, actually death, and bang, he is saved, that make it difficult for me to build up tension or to feel it, because he is saved by Deus Ex Machina again and again. Another example: Car total crash, he burns, he should actually burn (or freeze to death with the inverse logic), and in the next scene he lies in the infirmary and is saved - good thing, because otherwise the movie would already be over. But suspense works differently. These jumps make the \"experience\" of the film and especially the excitement quite difficult or impossible for me, because nothing happens to it.\nOr, to stay with the example above with the armored car, it jumps onto the roof, blows a hole through the steel and jumps inside. The plutonium is stored in another armored cabinet and what does the agent do: blow up, it worked just as well, it probably works here in the armored car as well, maybe 2 meters on 3 meters , steel around the outside, so a short explosive charge is attached, a little bit backed up, ignited, ... and of course it worked fine. No eardrum injury, eyes, hands and above all teeth still there. Either there is a physics in the film, then hold out, or there is just not, then we write Jumanji on it and well. For me this is not very realistic and a spoilsport.\nEspecially the things shown above are technical weaknesses for me, which should not occur with such a big budget.\nPeople\nOn the one hand we have the evil adversary:\nA Russian oligarch. He comes from a poor background. He has worked his way up and is also an arms dealer. He has a quite good infrastructure with trained combat teams and a yacht. The only bad thing is that he is terminally ill. His goal is to wipe out the entire world population, which is about 7.7 billion people. The motivation is for me absolutely unclear in the dimension. If I see it correctly, the motivation built up in the film is something like this: his wife wants to leave him and it is important for him that no one else gets her (i.e. kill her, which was not so obvious to me in the film, at least there were scenes that showed a different picture for me), then he is terminally ill, so he can't \"own\" the world any longer and so the conclusion from the first one: best would be to destroy the world, so that no one else lives either. Okay, take a deep breath, think, aha, supermotivation! For me this makes absolutely no sense, the motivation of Thanos is even more insightful (even if it was already moderately weak).\nHis wife, an art historian by profession and by the way quite unhappy with him so that she would like to separate from him. For me she still has a psychopathic disposition, because she cheats him out of 12 million dollars and tries to kill him on one or the other occasion. Probably with wealthy parents, otherwise studying as an art historian would not make sense. And it is just the woman for whom our secret agent endangers the mission several times and thus 7.7 billion people.\nWith the vita and motivation for the top villain probably not even The Asylum would have given money for a movie. To call the whole thing clich\u00e9d characters would be a pure understatement for me and wouldn't really do justice to it.\nAnd there we are at the secret agent. His job is to prevent the end of the world in a secret organization. If I as a viewer want to be part of a film, the protagonist has to suffer. You have to feel his pain almost vividly yourself. Just like the world is coming to an end, he must also come to an end. For me, that makes the film, the characters, tangible. But here it is different. After the \"resurrection\", a scientist tells him: \"There is time travel, and by the way, the world is also coming to an end...\". His reaction is: \"ah, o.k., yes, yawn...\" - somewhere between indifference and disinterest. Rather beside it than only with it. What do I care about the world shown - and for me as a viewer it was the same when it goes under, so what?\nAn emotional connection with the people, with the world never came up for me. You have to imagine when you receive such information. How it can torture you, how you can deal with it, etc., that could have given depth, but none of this in the film. Unfortunately, this goes on throughout the film. I never had an emotional connection with the protagonist. The super scientist didn't seem to be the brightest either. Because the protagonist had to give her the tip to examine the metal of the bullets to find out who made them. Actually, I would have thought that when it comes to the mission (extinction of mankind), a highly specialized scientific/military/state team would have to work together. But apparently nothing, on the contrary the secret agent is told several times that he actually lacks experience. So it seems to me that it makes sense to entrust him with the rescue of the world - actually it is rather like this, that when a blind man follows the other blind man, both of them fall into the pit.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Action,Sci-Fi,Thriller"}, "index_141": {"review_id": "rw2975001", "reviewer": "TheMovieSnob247", "movie": "her", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "A fascinating, completely unique film that must be seen!", "review_date": "6 March 2014", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "There's something beautifully ironic about a film where a man falls in love with an advanced artificial intelligence, yet it's one of the most emotionally powerful and compelling films of the year. I was stunned at how much this film moved me, so much so it cannot be denied: Spike Jonze has written and directed a modern day masterpiece for our tech savvy generation.It's sometime in the future in what appears to be a futuristic version of Los Angeles. We meet Theodore Twombly, a man who lives a clearly unfulfilled, lonely life working as a letter writer. While he can convey his emotions and thoughts very effectively at work, he lacks this ability in his real life and it's led to going through a divorce. One day he sees an ad for a new, advanced AI based OS and he decides to try it. His life is forever changed as he befriends this AI (Samantha) and eventually they form an unusual and unlikely relationship. First off let me this in an irresistible film and it will surprise you with how attached you get to these characters. Like most, I went in not entirely sure what to expect and given the subject matter, expecting the worst to be honest. But the acting was so convincing, the dialogue so well crafted, that very quickly into the film I just got lost in it. I believed in the connection between Theodore and Samantha, I felt it was tangible and real. Funny thing is, I'm not exactly sure at what point that happened, but it did. That's how effective it was and I have to give kudos to Spike Jonze for accomplishing this (and I'm very happy he got the Original Screenplay Oscar for his work, it absolutely deserved it).Her is an unpredictable, thought provoking, witty and funny film. It's about the power of connections and love as much as it is about technology and AI; it reminded me a little bit of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in that way. The performances in this film are what make it as good as it is. Joaquin Phoenix gave the performance of his life! I've seen seen a number of his movies and for me this is his most vulnerable, accessible performance, by far. I was bummed to see him forgotten among a really strong Best Actor awards field this year, but I feel like in time this performance will be appreciated a lot more. The voice over dialogue work by Scarlett Johanson is outstanding, if not ground breaking. These two performances put together are unlike anything I've seen in a film and they are what make this movie work; the relationship felt completely genuine, as weird as that sounds. It's as if she was right there on the screen, this was an incredible feat.I also thought Amy Adams was excellent in her small role; call me crazy, but I enjoyed her performance here a little more than her American Hustle role; I just found it a lot more genuine. I appreciated that the film wasn't overly preachy; instead of clubbing the viewer on the head with moral conundrums, it took a more introspective approach to advanced AI and not the usual apocalyptic angle (I found that refreshing). It was also very well paced as it didn't feel like it dragged on at any point. I really enjoyed the musical score and the visual effects were very impressive; I really liked the futuristic LA that was created in the film, it was pivotal to the overall plausibility of the film.While I was left with some questions at the end of the film, I was completely satisfied with the experience. One of the things I love about a great film is what happens after I leave the theatre; i.e. it's lingering impact. I was still thinking about this film days and even weeks after seeing. I couldn't help but wander, will something like this ever be possible? And if so, how far are we are from this? 10 years? 50? 100? It's really interesting to think about, as we may not be as far away from AI similar to this as we might think. I can't recommend this film enough; it's my second favourite film from 2013, just barely behind 12 Years a Slave.This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and is an instant favourite!@the_movie_snobwww.themoviesnob.ca", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_142": {"review_id": "rw2960156", "reviewer": "teajel", "movie": "her", "rating": "9", "review_summary": "A love story with thought and imagination.", "review_date": "13 February 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "The latest work of Spike Jonze has gathered a plethora of praise and positive feedback among critics and moviegoers in general (especially critics). even without that much buzz surrounding it, \"Her\" is Emotionally sophisticated and Visually absorbing. a strange wonderful tale between a man and computer that is genuinely heartfelt and passionately imaginative. It has been a long time, since a marvelous dramatic feature like this come out from Hollywood. for an obvious reason, a romantic feature that is highly captivating as well as thought provoking has been hard to come by. \"Her\" is such a tremendous achievement for Jonze, not only because of his artistic brilliance, but also his ability to envision the future of human relationship with technology as well as the fundamental aspect of human emotion.Set in the future, the lonely letter writer Theodore is desperate in search of a meaningful relationship after the separation with his beloved wife. Theodore is left unsatisfied and clueless about his life. his friendship with Amy seems formal without much attention garner between one another, since Amy has her personal problems as well. After a while, he decide to try a new developed computer OS being named Samantha as he chose a female assistant. Surprisingly, Samantha has enough wits and personality that Theodore found to be exciting and find comforts in her presence. Afterwards, Theodore begins to believe that Samantha is more than just a computer and starting to develop a relationship with her. for the first time after his divorce, Theodore has finally feel free and ready to have a commitment with Samantha.Basically, the story revolves around a man intimate relationship with his advance computer. on the surface, it is an offbeat and bittersweet romantic story with the futuristic possibility of a further A.I advancement as the premise. on a deeper interpretation, there is a philosophical questions about the boundaries of relationship between man and a machine. how we as a human will ever have a legitimate connection with artificial intelligence. and what will happen when they finally evolve like us in order to have such curiosity and complex emotion. the fundamental question is regarding the soul of a machine and its possibility to ever came into existences. given such high curiosity, Spike Jonze is willing to tackle those difficult question in an adequate manner in form of a simple love storyThe hyper-realism being use to capture the captivating futuristic setting is absorbing. like Jonze previous film \"Where The Wild Things Are\", his ability to create a sense of surreal reality is compelling. in \"Her\" he maintain his signature approach toward the movie setting and background, making the character richer in context. with highly talented cast like Joaquin Phoenix,Amy Adams,Scarlett Johanson and even Rooney Mara as the supporting reminiscent, the story feel more alive and captivating. Although its focal point lies within the chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johanson. Though much credit goes to Phoenix subversive portrayal as Theodore Johanson subtly voice bring much necessary wits and personality into Samantha. her lending voice is one of importance toward Samantha poignant connection with Theodore. While Amy Adams manage to relish every moment of her limited screen time. being spoken some of the film memorable dialog. Adams brief moment is momentarily significance. all of the cast seems fitted with their character, even Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde short appearance still left some impression.It is hard enough to find the bad faults within the film, because of Spike Jonze flawless visual and great acting. although the resolution between Theodore and Samantha is fairly obvious, it even reeks a little pretentious. nonetheless, it revels into this poetic and poignant endearment it was a \"beautiful pretentiousness\" indeed. the plot is also kept at deliberate pace, which is part of Jonze signature approach for whatever reason. though his slow pacing has given us some space to reflect the character and its parallel reality. simply put,every moment of visual brilliance is enough to be cherish in this thoughtful futuristic analogy.", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Drama,Romance,Sci-Fi"}, "index_143": {"review_id": "rw6179685", "reviewer": "sweidman-28016", "movie": "kajillionaire", "rating": "8", "review_summary": "Intoxicating", "review_date": "16 October 2020", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "\"We can only ever be how we are.\"Miranda July has won me over with her writing and directing. I haven't seen any of her other works but just from this movie I can tell she's someone I should look out for in the future. As a crime-comedy, this works on all levels. Through it all I was entertained. I found the comedy refreshing and worked around human emotion rather than making dumb jokes. What really invested me is the drama. Coming out of the theater I felt like I went through an existential crisis. Starting around the second act, at a certain moment in fact, things take a turn. Not a twist in the story but rather the tone and theme. I enjoyed the first act but wanted a little more out of it. Initially I thought the film would follow this plot with some drama weaved in there somehow. Well that drama came in the most unexpected way where it felt like a kick in the gut. From that moment on I hoped the film wouldn't end.As a filmmaker, July has a distinct style. She could be categorized under a similar style as Wes Anderson and Taika Waititi. The wide shots showing the uniqueness of the characters early on tell the audience what they're getting into. The camera work in general is well done. There's a scene that everyone will take away after viewing where the cinematography, writing, and directing come hand-in-hand. The way it's done could've been told in a normal fashion, but July makes an awesome decision. I found myself just gawking at the screen.Through the character of Old Dolio, life lessons are told. Evan Rachel Wood has an amazing transformative performance. Had I not known previously that she is the lead, I would've never guessed. There's something about the film that felt off and it took me a few days to figure it out. Throughout the film, Old Dolio is discovering truths about life. They're truths that we all know about, though, so there's a bit of a connection issue with her character and script. Not that you can't connect with her character because there are some really emotional gripping scenes, but since you know more about the real world than her it's a little more difficult to feel exactly what she's feeling. The character that we can (hopefully) relate to most is Gina Rodriguez. One of her better performances since Annihilation and Jane the Virgin, she brings a lot more to the film than expected. What first seems like a cameo from her actually turns out to be a key role. Richard Jenkins always does a great job and that's no exception here. I found him to be comical yet extremely frustrating. And finally Debra Winger has a similar performance to Jenkins. They match each other well as a duo and she has a powerful scene with Evan Rachel Wood.Much like The Favourite and Phantom Thread, Kajillionaire becomes increasingly the intoxicating every day after watching. The great score by Emile Moserri has been on repeat in my head and on Spotify. Scenes have played out when I close my eyes. What started as really good movie has become one of the best of the year for me. I urge you to see Kajillionaire.

Russell's highly anticipated American Hustle in which assembles some of Hollywood's most sought-after talent that includes Oscar-winners Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence along with Oscar-nominees Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner. He teams up with scribe Eric Singer, whose only feature writing credit is Tom Tykwer's The International, and based on the popularity of last year's Silver Linings Playbook, this was suppose to be Russell's masterpiece. Sad to report that the final product is an anti- metamorphosis of filmmaking that prohibits any consistency for the viewer to relish. What remains intact and palpable are the outstanding performances by the cast that Russell put together. All of them are dedicated to their roles, even when development and direction are lacking, and they truck through much of the narrative successfully.One of the largest areas of opportunities is the script composed by Singer and Russell. Despite scene-chewing performances from our principal actors, an absence of insight and cohesiveness, along with an irregularity of interesting dialogue plagues this once promising Oscar hopeful. In the first twenty minutes of the film's opening, I said to myself, \"this is going to be my favorite film of the year.\" When the film ventures off into back stories and character origins, it plays like a parody of Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights, lacking any emotional connection. The film isn't overtly dreadful or horrendous by any stretch, just mostly disappointing. All the pieces are there, they just didn't take the time to make sure they all fit. It's confusing in tone, though very funny at times, especially coming from Cooper and Lawrence, but by the end, Russell feels he's warranted an emotional reaction from the audience when he's done anything but.Christian Bale is terrific, magnified in charisma while still keeping mostly all his ticks and mannerisms he's created for Irving in perspective. His work is also an impressive counterpoint to his other well-executed performance in Out of the Furnace. Bale proves once again that he's one of this generation's most gifted actors. Not only in the way he packs on the pounds, or rocks a comb-over better than any wannabe gangster I've encountered on the streets of Little Italy; he's the one performer that has a character that goes through an authentic evolution that's believable.As the spunky and crude wife of Irving, Jennifer Lawrence gets the biggest laughs and commands the most attention from the viewer. Better than she was in last year's overly praised turn in Silver Linings Playbook, for which she won the Oscar for Best Actress, this is a role that suits her well, both for her range as an actress and what she excels in with her fiery demeanor. I'm still a bit unsure about how old Rosalyn was suppose to be (that may be a fault of these directors thinking she's old enough to play these older women). Lawrence owns her role and has enough naughty sex-appeal and delivery to land herself an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. I'd argue if she hadn't JUST won last year, she would be a formidable threat to win. Probably a more appropriate representation for her acting arsenal.I have fallen hard for the abilities of Bradley Cooper following his role as Pat in Russell's Playbook. Subsequently, the 38-year-old actor has sought dynamic and challenging roles that you can tell he finds exciting and prolific in its nature and candor. His turn in The Place Beyond the Pines earlier this year proved that notion and in American Hustle, Cooper is simply dazzling. Delivering the best performance of the cast, Cooper nails moment after moment, infusing his strict and intense line delivery while having impeccable comedic timing. One sequence in which he imitates the great Louie C.K., who plays one of Richie's frazzled superiors, engulfed the movie theater in non-stop laughter.The actor I feel the most for is the talented and beautiful Amy Adams. If the script was more developed on a writing level, this role could have been the performance of the year. Adams is given an opportunity to enrich herself in a woman, full of layers, that prevent her from losing sight of her own identity. However, being short-changed as her character builds, leaves the audience unsatisfied with where she ends. On a pure performance level, Adams is top-notch, conveying one of her strongest turns yet. I wished more for her but ultimately was let down.David O. Russell used to be able to excite, in the way that Quentin Tarantino would when ventured off into a new realm of his imagination. His 2010 film The Fighter was his most ambitious outing and I've waited, patiently mind you, to see when he top that endeavor. I'll always award his efforts as a writer. I Heart Huckabees, Three Kings, and Silver Linings Playbook succeed mostly on the merits of his storytelling ability. American Hustle levels out a lot of the time, enabling the viewer to connect and engage the world convincingly. There are other times though, where honestly, I almost fell asleep. Even when Russell demonstrates uneven filmmaking, I've remained bound to the story. This is the first time I found myself bored, especially in scenes involving Jeremy Renner, who I adore.Read more @ AwardsCircuit.com", "publish_date": "2013", "category": "Crime,Drama"}, "index_145": {"review_id": "rw3434735", "reviewer": "ShiZiph", "movie": "dead man walking", "rating": "10", "review_summary": "The movie is telling the story of a sentenced murderer and rapist who is waiting for his execution.", "review_date": "20 March 2016", "spoiler_tag": 0, "review_detail": "First of all: this movie is so well acted that you are directly connected to the emotions of the characters just by looking into their faces.

The \"black windmill\" of the title is one of the two Clayton Windmills (known locally as \"Jack and Jill\") on the South Downs near Brighton; this windmill plays an important part in the plot.As in \"The Ipcress File\", Caine plays a British secret service agent, but his character here, John Tarrant, is very different to Harry Palmer. Whereas Palmer was a working-class outsider, a former Army sergeant who was virtually blackmailed into joining the secret service to avoid a criminal charge, Tarrant is an establishment insider, part of the officer class. (He holds the rank of Major). He is engaged in an undercover operation to counter the activities of a gang of arms smugglers selling weapons to terrorists in Northern Ireland. (The film was made in 1974 when the Northern Irish troubles were at their height).The film starts with Tarrant's young son David being kidnapped and held to ransom. The kidnappers appear to have a detailed knowledge not only of Tarrant's family circumstances but also of the work he is engaged on; as their ransom they demand a valuable quantity of uncut diamonds which he has recently acquired to fund his intelligence work. Tarrant initially believes that the kidnappers are connected either to the arms dealers or to the terrorists for whom they are working, and confides in his superior, Cedric Harper. As matters progress, however, he begins to wonder whether matters are really as they seem and whether he can really trust his colleagues.This is far from being Caine's worst film. (For an actor of his distinction he made more than his fair share of dreadful ones, \"Blame It on Rio\" and \"Ashanti\" being two that come to mind). It does, however, highlight one of his weaknesses as an actor, namely that in the early part of his career he was not very good at conveying strong emotions. Most of his iconic roles, at least from this period, involved him playing characters who, for one reason or another, avoid showing much emotion. This could be because they need to keep up the \"stiff upper lip\" (his characters in \"Zulu\" and \"Battle of Britain\"), because they hide their feelings beneath a mask of impassivity (Jack Carter), because they deliberately avoid emotional commitment (Alfie Elkins) or because they try and distance themselves from their feelings through cynicism and irony (Frank in \"Educating Rita\"). Certainly, some of his more mature performances do show greater emotional depth, such as \"The Honorary Consul\" and \"The Quiet American\", but in \"The Black Windmill\" he is rather wooden, never suggesting the anguish and anxiety of a man whose son is being held for ransom.Some of the acting is better; Janet Suzman as Tarrant's estranged wife Alex provides the emotional conviction that Caine's performance lacks, while Donald Pleasence is very effective as the smooth but unsympathetic and possibly duplicitous Harper. The film as a whole is a professionally made thriller, if not a very original one, but an essentially American director like Siegel was not the most natural choice to direct a British spy thriller like this one. \"The Black Windmill\" is never going to rank on his filmography as highly as the likes of \"Dirty Harry\" and \"The Shootist\". 6/10", "publish_date": "1974", "category": "Action,Crime,Thriller"}, "index_147": {"review_id": "rw5767841", "reviewer": "PyroSikTh", "movie": "synecdoche, new york", "rating": "5", "review_summary": "A Philosophy Lecture with Meaningless Padding", "review_date": "24 May 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "My mind is still attempting to unravel everything seventeen hours later - and nearly 2 hours of that was spent watching YouTube analyses just to enhance my understanding. This review is going to be as much about exploring the movie in my own head than anything, so strap yourselves in, we're going on a journey!At its core and most literal surface, Synecdoche is about a theatre director, Caden Cotard, as he breezes through love, life, work, and death. After his artistic wife leaves him and takes their daughter with her, he's given a MacArthur grant, and he endeavours to deconstruct human existence itself by recreating New York City in a warehouse. It becomes an ambitious, never-ending project that tells his life story as it happens. And yet this doesn't actually describe the movie at all, because the movie is not literal at all, and it's packed with so many layers that its core plot is meaningless; just a vessel for the movie's themes and subtexts to be explored to infinitum. This is where my biggest barrier to this movie resides. It's almost all subtext. The subtext is so far on top of the text that it ceases to even be subtext. Without a solid plot to follow, it devolves into a montage of ideas splashed on the screen, and the story it wants to tell could easily have been a philosophy lecture.So what are the themes Synecdoche wants to explore? Literally everything. The movie itself is as ambitious as Caden's theatre project. Synecdoche is about life and human existence, and it aims to tap into the most intimate parts of what makes us human. It explores the passage of time and growing old, it explores identity, it explores gender, it explores our purpose and meaning on this world, it explores creativity, it explores death and its effect on those around us, it explores the inherent solipsism of being a conscious being contained in your own meat suit, it explores who you are, who you are to everyone else, and who everyone else is to you. The titular synecdoche is looking at one human in place of the entirety of humanity across all ages and continents. Caden is you, Caden is me, Caden is your postman, Caden is the girl you like, Caden is the guy in the White House, Caden is the untold billions of people who have died and are yet to be born, and yet Caden is no-one. Caden is a character played by an actor, played by an actor, in a play, in a movie.But hey, Caden's not a very likeable character right? He's selfish and self-absorbed, he's pessimistic and depressed, he's a hypochondriac obsessed with his own death, he is unable to leave the past behind and move on, he's a terrible father and a terrible husband. That's not like me. That's not like you. How can we related and empathise with this guy? The very negativity surrounding his character challenges us to look at ourselves. We're all obsessed with death in one way or another, we're all unable to leave elements of the past behind, we're all terrible at doing what we should be good at, and by the very nature of being human we are all selfish and self-absorbed. Caden is the very worst an average human can be, which is nothing like us on an individual level, and yet he shares traits with us all on a macro level.And that's great, but here comes my criticism. With a character so monumentally terrible and easy to dislike, it makes the fact there are various women in his life seem unreasonable and demeaning. Almost every interaction he has with a woman feels like a male fantasy. Hazel effortlessly falls for him and flirts tirelessly, Claire deems him a genius - a god amongst men, his therapist seduces him at every opportunity, Tammy jumps at the chance to strip naked in front of him and beckons him to bed, and even Adele leaves him with the words \"I love you\" despite quite clearly not. And these are not easily explainable as mere delusions either, because almost every single one is acted upon by those women. Maybe I could swallow this if Caden was depicted as even the slightest bit charming or handsome, but he isn't. He's miserable and unloving, and let's be honest, Philip Seymour Hoffman wasn't exactly the greatest looking guy in the world. What was it about him that made him so irresistible to these women? It reduces the women of his life to objects of desire, to sex dolls, to baby factories. Their personalities are defined by Caden's existence, and their characters are nothing outside of that.\nThis ties into another of the movie's themes, that is literally spelled out in the movie's dialogue. We're all the main characters of our own stories. Caden is the main character of the movie, and so all the women he encounters are just side characters who don't really matter. But this is juxtaposed somewhat by the notion that there are no side characters. Everyone has their own story and their own personality, but Caden is the only one here who actually gets one. Everyone else is just an empty husk for him to project characters on to. It's such a fine line between making its point and undermining its point that I'm not even sure which side of the line I sit on.So let's get meta here, because Synecdoche is a hugely meta movie. By the movie's close, Caden himself just becomes an actor playing a character, taking directions from an unseen director, played by an actor, playing him. It becomes easy to extrapolate that out further and see Caden not as Caden, but as Philip Seymour Hoffman. He's just an actor playing a character, acting out the part of the another character, while another actor plays the part of Caden. Find this hard to follow? That's the movie. Is Caden an actual character we're meant to get involved with, or are we just watching Philip Seymour Hoffman play a part? Synecdoche doesn't shy away from the fact that its fictional characters are fictional, and that the real story being told is one behind the cameras. Caden is just a vessel, and everyone else who stars - Catherine Keener, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Samantha Morton, Michelle Williams, Tom Noonan, Emily Watson, Hope Davis - are just actors playing parts in a play in a movie. It's so meta and self-aware it hurts, and the best explanation I can find is that the movie is pointing out how we're all just playing characters of ourselves. Is who we are real? Or just a character we've created in our minds? Who are you really? Who am I? Who am I to you? The way you see me is different to the way I see myself, and vice versa. The way you present yourself to me is different to how you present yourself to someone else. Are you a happy character today? Or are you only tragic with me?Synecdoche, New York is not a movie that makes literal sense. Months pass by in a single morning, in a detail I didn't even notice until the YouTube videos I watched. Some people grow old while others don't grow at all. Caden is stuck in slow motion waiting for the weeks to pass, while others are blissfully aware of the years. It makes a good point of how fast time gets away from us. We're children, then we're adults, and then suddenly we're old. However from a narrative viewpoint it just turns an already confusing movie into something nearly impossible to follow literally. Has it been weeks or years? Is Caden going mad or is the movie just making point? I waited two hours for the movie to offer an ah-ha! moment, and it never came. It wants to be a fever dream where time doesn't exist, but never takes the surrealism beyond reality. We're left in a world that looks and acts like reality, but is actually a dream without indication of it being such.I hear it's a movie that improves with repeat viewings, but I'm not even sure I want to watch it again. There was nothing here to grab me, shake me, and demand it be watched again. There's no moments, just ideas. Even the emotion is ripped out from underneath it by trying so hard to make a point. Caden's story is an emotional one, losing family and loved ones, losing himself in a creative rut without end. Even the themes it dabbles with are emotional ones, questioning who we are, who we are to other people, and why we are. And yet the film is such a pretentious mess that the emotional aspects are hollowed out in favour of philosophical existentialism. Screw story. Screw character. Screw emotional stakes. All that matters are the points being made about humanity on both a micro and macro level. But without those, it just becomes a philosophy lecture with meaningless dressing. I cannot fault the pure thought and creativity that went into this movie, and I can see why some people hail it a masterpiece, but for me it fell flat on everything that makes a movie a movie. I'd rather have had Kaufman come into my living room and shouted at me that we're all going to die with regrets, and that we're all the main characters in our own stories. It would have been just as effective, without me having to mentally dissect what the hell is going on for two long hours, only for the credits to roll and just feel lost and confused, and requiring nearly two hours of other people explaining what the hell is going on before I managed to connect all the dots.I guess I need to give this a rating, right? Eh, I don't know. A 5/10 maybe? Philip Seymour Hoffman was existentially fantastic, Emily Watson was the most perfect casting to play Samantha Morton's character, as I get them both confused all the time, the sheer attention to detail is staggering, and Jon Brion's score has it's Eternal Sunshine moments. But it just wasn't for me.", "publish_date": "2008", "category": "Drama"}, "index_148": {"review_id": "rw6077505", "reviewer": "elpi25", "movie": "mulan", "rating": "5", "review_summary": "The original was better", "review_date": "9 September 2020", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "I had to revive my account just so I can give a review of this movie lol. This is one, or if not my most favorite Disney movie, and I really had high hopes for the action film. Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations.Here are some points that I like from the film:\nI love that they give more importance to the \"True\" virtue by relating it to Mulan's storyline. The original didn't emphasize this muchThe setting, although still not accurate, looks better than the originalFor the cons:\nThe acting was monotonous and not that good. I get that Mulan's maybe an introvert, but the actress' eyes and gestures should show what she feels even if there are no lines. Like the scene where she flew from above with her sword. Where are the emotions in your eyes???The characters. I don't feel connected to the characters. I didn't know them, and the fact that there's no music to introduce them made me feel that they're just background characters and nothing more. Also, the sister is unnecessary. She was just used as a character who would ruin Mulan's encounter with the matchmaker lolThe weaving of the story. a) The film did not highlight how the other soldiers got better in fighting. Not one died in the fight in the end. How??? b) Also, the story arc with the witch is kinda meh. It was just put there as an ornament, and not an important part of the movie. c) Her decision to go to war instead of his father was not highlighted at all. The scene just cut to her riding the horse with her armor on.The love story arc. It's a good thing that the movie did not dwell much in the love story arc of Mulan, but her connection with the new guy kinda seemed forced. It didn't feel organic to me. I just wish that they alloted more time for the two to develop feelings for each other.Overall, the film is still enjoyable. But, if I were to choose which version do I like better, I'd still choose the animated one.", "publish_date": "2020", "category": "Action,Adventure,Drama"}, "index_149": {"review_id": "rw2933926", "reviewer": "TheSeaLion", "movie": "lost in translation", "rating": "7", "review_summary": "A one in a million kind of film", "review_date": "2 January 2014", "spoiler_tag": 1, "review_detail": "Who would have thought that Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson would have such great chemistry? Not me until I saw this masterpiece of cinematography a few weeks ago. I did not have much of an interest in watching this movie when I first heard how great it was and decided to watch it. After viewing it, I realized I wished I'd seen it sooner.Bob Harris (Murray) is an actor who has arrived in Tokyo to shoot a commercial. Charlotte (Johansson) is a young woman who married young and is in Tokyo with her husband (Giovanni Ribsi) who is a celebrity photographer on business. Harris is going through a mid-life crisis while Charlotte feels she made a mistake marrying when she was so young. The two will form an unlikely bond with one another and take the audience on an experience through their different worlds and problems. The slow pace of the film helps it feel like the buildup of their relationship is actually taking time instead of happening all at once. The two share a lot of things in common, including having problems with where they are in life right now and a feeling of loneliness which adds depth to both the characters and their relationship. Instead of telling the story about these two very different yet very similar people form an emotional connection with each other, the film takes you on the experience they have and how the connection between them grows.The visuals and setting of the film in Tokyo provides for an interesting location that plays a role in adding depth to the story and characters using its subtle symbolism. Both Bob and Charlotte feel alienated in their lives as if they do not belong there, and Tokyo to them is an unfamiliar and alien place to them with a different culture and language then they're used to. I thought Scarlett Johansson was an okay actress from the performance I witnessed in the 'Marvel' films \"Iron Man 2\" and \"The Avengers\", but her performance in this made me realize how talented she is and has made her one of my favorite actresses. Bill Murray I already liked and knew was good actor from his performance in \"Ghostbusters\", but this shows he can do comedy as well as serious drama. I would actually love to see Murray do some more serious roles because you can tell he is built for both funny and serious with his performance in this. Another good acting job in the film was Anna Faris of the \"Scary Movie\" franchise as an American actress named Kelly. The best part of the whole film is the relationship that Bob and Charlotte share with one another. We get a front row seat as the two take the audience on a journey through the experience they shared together and how it shaped their relationship. The two have great chemistry and have a strong relationship that the audience wants to route for. The best part of the relationship, I think, is that it allows the audience to believe what they want to believe with it. I personally believe that it is just a very strong friendship that they share while others think that they have some romantic chemistry between them. Whatever the case is, I like that it took the chance and the film did not tell us, but instead lets the individual viewer believe what they take from it all.\"Lost in Translation\" is a one in a million film that while simple in premise is deep in all other areas. Murray and Johansson have good chemistry, the setting of the film plays an interesting role in symbolizing how the two feel, there are good performances in the movie, and the film allows us to decide what we want about the two, \"Lost in Translation\" is a modern day masterpiece and dives into great detail about a simple bond that two people share.", "publish_date": "2003", "category": "Comedy,Drama"}}
