       "\"I feel not since the UK version of the The Office has RG's study of life had more meaning. This series is full of pure and raw emotion - it's ability to tap into the innerself and the ensuing conflict of feelings during a period of loss is incredible. I am in a very long and happy marriage and I often contemplate how I would react if my spouse was taken from me either through illness or an unexpected event and I can see myself reacting somewhat like the main character excellently portrayed by Ricky Gervais. I am not sure it would be a suitable post-bereavement therapy ...but after some time had passed perhaps it would actually help some people come to terms in a small way to their loss. The mixture of sadness and laughable circumstances, his criticisms and observations on society as whole has been nailed down to tee. Bravo Mr Gervais your best work to date and long may your creative genius continue - deffo a 11 out of 10 .\""
